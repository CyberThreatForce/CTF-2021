Dear Agent,

We have been monitoring an internal website for some time now for suspicious activity.
To be precise, a source in the karmenovian military infrastructure made a mirror website of their internal webserver.
Some of the source code has been translated by our source in french.
We recently had confirmation of our suspicion and need you to move forward and investigate.

Best of luck and may the hack be with you.
