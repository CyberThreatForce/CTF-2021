cybersecurity,nonvg2,Mentorship Monday,Cartercarter2012,h011myk,t3_nonvg2,0,Is it wise to get an associate degree oin cybersecurity to land a job ?
cybersecurity,nonvg2,Mentorship Monday,imFinnaDo,h07vnuh,t3_nonvg2,0,"I've been doing iT for 15 years.  My current job has a decent amount of cyber security tasks; perimeter protections, end user training and awareness, incident response, etc.  I really enjoy those parts of the job and want to do that type of work full time.

What would be the best way to transition into an info sec job?  Has anyone been in a similar situation and successfully done this?"
cybersecurity,nonvg2,Mentorship Monday,mawbrown2012,h09nf2d,t3_nonvg2,0,"Hey everyone, I transitioned out of the military a year ago. During that year I was able to push and get my A+, Net+, Sec+ and a hand full of MTAs. I've been working help desk for almost a year now. My current role is help desk as a government contractor.

 I am very interested in getting into the cybersecurity side of things but unsure how to do so. I'm mostly interested in the pentest side of security but am open to options as all of security peaks my interest.

I'm looking into using my GI bill and getting a degree in Computer Science with a focus on Cybersecuirty. I would love some opinions as to whether that's a good idea and maybe some additional steps I can take to get a Jumpstart on knowledge in the field."

My end goal is to move from my current role as a physical SOC operator to a SOC analyst and do threat analysis and attribution. There are BootCamps offered by the local state university, however they’re 12,500$ so I want to make sure it’s going to be good for me before I make a commitment. 

Basically my question for others would be, what paths did you take to get certified and did these paths provide you with enough knowledge to enter into your first position with confidence or would you rather have paid more for more information."

Do I just enrol into a computer science undergrad program? I know absolutely nothing about computers, I already have a completed BA from a decade ago."
cybersecurity,nonvg2,Mentorship Monday,TheCarnundrum,h07xf83,t3_nonvg2,0,"Hey everyone. My company is going to pay for me to take some cybersecurity training/classes and I wanted to get a couple of opinions. Our workplace is 100% remote and cloud-based (by design, not COVID related), meaning we have no in-house servers, networking equipment, anything like that, but we DO have a staff with a variety of different devices, home internet setups, etc. Since the company is paying for this, they'd want whatever training I take to be at least applicable to our scenario (primarily they're concerned with securing our Google Workspace and macOS security since most people use Macs in our company, but I'd like to be able to apply it to different workplace configurations as well. I'm not necessarily looking for a certification, so whatever I take doesn't necessarily need to fall into the certification training realm.

I'm primarily interested in the defense side of things, though I'd at least like to learn about various techniques used on offense (which I assume is part of learning defensive security regardless). I am familiar with UNIX-like OSes and their typical filesystem layouts, shell scripting, Linux init systems (init.d and systemd) and am very comfortable in a terminal. Windows is actually a huge blindspot for me because I haven't used it much in the last 10 years.

If you have any suggestions/recommendations based on this, I'd love to have them. Thanks to you all for setting up this thread & participating. I've found it helpful reading as a lurker for a bit."

cybersecurity,nonvg2,Mentorship Monday,Trishla12,h0f6wvi,t3_nonvg2,0,"Hey,

I plan to do my Masters in Cybersecurity from the states soon. While comparing the curriculum of different programs, I observed they are either highly inclined towards management (policies, frameworks, GRC etc) or the core engineering stuff (network security, reverse analysis etc). 

As I proceed further it would be a great help if you guys could share some insights on the job prospects after each of these programs and their demand in US.

P.S- I have 2 years of work experience in this field as a Threat Hunter & Malware Researcher.

~Thanks"

Any notable hardware requirements to be aware of? At least 8 gigs for VM’s? Is the power of the processor relevant?"
cybersecurity,nonvg2,Mentorship Monday,Scrooge_Mcducks,h0h5yod,t3_nonvg2,0,"Hi everyone 

I work for a brand new startup and we are trying to grow our platform. We specialize in PAM and IAM and have created a solution that manages companies current identity access platforms through one central dashboard. In addition, we’re able to assign roles and are gauging how an employee/user could be compromised through their personalities. For example, if an employee is an active member of social media (extrovert) they are more likely to be compromised through social media attacks and our AI creates “confidence levels” on their actions in an organization. Its similar to a guardrail around a companies digital assets that manages and monitors credential access. 

Since we’re so extremely new we’re trying to grow and find the correct avenues to find companies to beta test our solution. If anyone has any advice on this it would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks!"

cybersecurity,nonvg2,Mentorship Monday,Ghawblin,h0b9gj9,t1_h07vnuh,1,"I did IT for a few years before going into CyberSec.

Get your Security+, and start applying. You already have relevant experience to the point you likely don't need to worry about A+ or Net+. 

Easier said than done, but it's that simple!"
cybersecurity,nonvg2,Mentorship Monday,gettingtherequick,h0b0ce2,t1_h09nf2d,1,"With your A+, Net+ and Sec+, you already have the basic background for cyber. No need to spend more time on a college degree (you can always do it part-time later on if needed).

For pen-testing, I'd suggest learn some basic hacking (watch YouTube, get some hacking books...), then apply to work in a SOC, probably start working some night shift. SOC is kind like IT helpdesk, tons of repetitive stuffs but you'll learn a lot."
cybersecurity,nonvg2,Mentorship Monday,mildlyincoherent,h02xldt,t1_h01senn,1,"Depends on the role.

https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/Glossary.html is a good start, though not all will be applicable. You'll also probably want to under how a vuln assessment works (cvss, environmental, and specific to instances), how to prioritize Remediation, how to do threat modeling, etc.

Then there's all the various scanning and assessment tools, but that will depend on the job as well.

Lastly a bunch of basics. Asymmetrical vs symmetrical encryption. How does the internet and networking work. Hashing with work. Etc etc etc.

There's a lot to pick up. Knowing what niche you're aiming for will help narrow it down."
cybersecurity,nonvg2,Mentorship Monday,gettingtherequick,h06wdkh,t1_h04ec7f,1,"Typically it is through personal connection. Think from the opposite angle, if you are really good at something, what would make you willing to share that skill/knowledge with someone?"
cybersecurity,nonvg2,Mentorship Monday,Rural-goat-herder,h0ckmzr,t1_h0ck3q0,1,Hi I’m finishing my degree in industrial & systems engineering and a minor in critical intel. I’ve been looking into the cyber security career and have gotten a few messages from recruiters but I’m not sure how much computer science I am suppose to know to get in. Most of these jobs say no experience needed(mostly gov jobs) but it makes me a bit nervous how much comp sci would you say you’d need to understand?
cybersecurity,nonvg2,Mentorship Monday,jazzjo,h0fqc4u,t1_h0fg3z4,1,"i cant speak to the job field itself. but im currently in a bootcamp to be a SOC Analyst myself. This program called Per Scholas is free but you have to be willing to move to where the job is located. i was lucky enough to be in Indiana where one of the jobs is being needed. So i would say look into that, they can give you more information."
cybersecurity,nonvg2,Mentorship Monday,TrustmeImaConsultant,h02m8hz,t1_h019hfn,1,"An AI can by definition not be creative. This in turn is required to come up with new exploits. Because, well, if it could be found by fuzzing and algorithms, it would not be a problem because QA would have taken care of that.

What AI will do is to make some automation tasks easier or even take them over. At the same time, AI is about on par with human stupidity when it comes to exploiting it, so I dare say we'll very likely see a much larger field of security open up when these things are used in force, because so far I don't see security consciousness being a huge concern in the development of AI.

It's gonna be IoT all over. But bigger."

cybersecurity,nonvg2,Mentorship Monday,CaliEAST,h04jk0f,t1_h03a2fr,1,"1) get a computer. 

2) get a job at a company with combined cyber/physical security so you are at least in the realm of the role you want and can learn about all the areas to pursue.

3) Focus on your strength: you have a strong base in understanding concepts in security and protection/defense. 

4) If there is ANYTHING in your current role that involves working online/security related - do that to get your resume pointed in the right direction.

I started in Physical Security and have been working in Cyber for a long time now."

I've been studying at night and on weekends for about 2 years now, and have knocked out nearly 3/4 of my Bachelor's (switched majors to Networks & Cyber Security) and gotten CompTIA A+, Net+, Sec+. It will be difficult but don't look back. I see a lot of law enforcement and military guys that want to make the transition but get bogged down from the stressful job and workload... But just keep going and never look back. I used Udemy Mike Meyers and Youtube Professor Messer for CompTIA courses, now going to do CEH and eJPT. Good luck!"
cybersecurity,nonvg2,Mentorship Monday,CaliEAST,h04l4un,t1_h03kcka,1,"Which do you like more? Go there. 

Having a strong network background USED to be the most common path into security, but thats not the case today. Strong networking will help for sure, but you will have to expand to succeedl in security.

Long term security will probably  be a more specialized field than networking (read: higher pay/less commodity/outsourcing risk)"

* Experience - Get a couple years in the Network Engineering or Sysadmin type role. No one is going to trust you to secure a system if you've never had to administer it before

* Degree - eh, mostly optional but a associates in SOMETHING tech related won't hurt. It's mostly to get past HR

* Certifications - Focus here. Net+ and Sec+ are where to start, they're offered by comptia. After that start looking at CySA+ and CASP+."

If you compliment this with certifications and some job experience (even if it's in IT), I think one would do well breaking into the security industry.

Networking yourself is also pretty important. I knew two coworkers that got into security with just a couple of comptia certs (no degree or previous security experience). The other had an associates in biology and some IT experience. But they both knew the right people already in the industry.

The punishment cannot be a fine, because corporations will simply work the fine into their cost of doing business. It needs to made crystal fucking clear: if your company pays a ransom, your executives get put in cages.

Like, say, the interprocess communication within containers running on cri-o (of course picking something completely at random, not because I thought I knew something about that particular thing and was shown that I know fuck all about it in a 30 minute panel...).

The thing is, you're not in competition with anyone but yourself. As long as you manage to know more than the guy you were yesterday, you're getting ahead.

How about Google search home page which people go there all the time, if you can slip your code on that home page, that's a sophisticated attack.

cybersecurity,nrc8ls,"""Sophisticated"" cybersecurity attacks",Angretlam,h0fmn8i,t3_nrc8ls,0,"As a cybersecurity professional, I label sophisticated attacks that have the following criteria:

* New/Unique methods of breach/attack/C2/extraction.
* Demonstrated maturity in the cyber kill chain.
* Typically involve complex attack vectors which stack multiple vulnerabilities to achieve an outcome.
* Go beyond opensource/COTS capabilities of malware groups (no script kiddies allowed).
* Demonstrated organizational maturity within the threat actor.

To borrow from a different world, a truly good chef can make or break a gourmet restaurant. People see the Chef as distinguished and appreciate the value that they bring. This is not the case for places such as olive garden where the local chef is following a protocol set in some far off lab. While olive garden might provide an OK experience that surpasses the fast food experiences, it's still nothing in terms of execution compared to a 5 star chef. 

So while TTPs might generally be the same across all attack chains, it's how they are arranged and executed that makes a world of difference.

To give a practical example, a sophisticated attacker is aware of the kinds of tools in the industry and will work in stealth mode as long as they want within a given network. They will avoid creating any kind of noise by creating their own methodologies so that bolt on products like EDR/AV/Network Sniffers don't see any issues. A mediocre attacker will walk into the network, start running a tool like Mimikatz and wonder how they got caught because they didn't understand the noise level they generated by bringing such a tool into a network."

*Sophisticated* attacks are something much different. Well funded, well planned, and well orchestrated. Typically (but not always) conducted by a threat actor with extreme patience. They collect intelligence and establish persistence. Possibly using vectors or vulnerabilities not previously identified. A great example of a *sophisticated* attack is the SolarWinds incident. We know that the threat actor established persistence long before they started to operationalize their payloads. In fact, had the threat actor not made the mistake of targeting FireEye-a company uniquely positioned to identify what was going on-who knows how long they would have gone unnoticed."

The only reason I see to implement IPv6 at this point in time is if your entire company can subsist on IPv6 internally and externally. You'll want to validate that all of your IoT (printers in particular) support IPv6. Theoretically, when the world switches over to IPv6, then you'll be ready. But, we've been saying IPv6 is the way for years now...and we are still using IPv4 regularly.

Beyond future proofing, IPv6 can provide some options for managing your corporate WAN/LAN better. You can create IPv6 groups which enable your devices to communicate directly with less network level management. In theory this should reduce some of the costs associated with network level segmentation/hardware as it can be done through the networking software stack on endpoints."

In your example, you might end up with a really long password, but it starts with a simple password, this is your algorithms IV. If that password is too simple (password), then it makes it very easy to attack later since I can take a hash of any string. But you think ""Oh, but I've secured it by adding random characters on the end!"", yet this means you're STILL having to memorize something on your password all the while crippling the security of the first 10 characters (oops)."

What happens when two of your passwords are leaked, and a hacker sees that your account for YouTube is ""Qp*(ej7aocYT"" and your password for Facebook is ""Qp*(ej7aocFB"".

You can solve this one by appending the site-specific characters to the simple password rather than the first 10 characters of the hash, so the final passwords are completely different.

What if a site has different password composition rules, like no ( character?

What happens when one of your sites forces a password change? Now you have to remember that site has different symbols appended. So you need to keep a list of your sites and what characters are appended. At that point you might as well use a password manager. A password manager solves all three of these problems.

While I would agree that a law like this should be met with criticism it’s evident that they are trying to cut down the financial success of the attacks.

It seems a concern with this law is that a company would pay the ransom illegally and not disclose the hack. I would argue that this already happens today and that perhaps steeper punishment needs to be placed on organizations and individuals whom neglect to disclose the occurrence of data breaches.

I could see where in certain scenarios it might be the best course of action to pay the ransom. However that decision should only be made with the involvement of the government and likely done in private."

That said, everyone's frustrated by ransomware except the extortionists.  Making ransom payments illegal won't solve anything.

There's a mindset that has to change, and that is that the currently accepted costs of doing business are in the right balance.  By that I mean the budgeting process and budgeting assumptions are assumed to be correct because ""every"" company is applying the same standards and setting similar percentages.

IT budgets have been ""X percent of revenue"" and IT leaders have had bonuses dependent upon reducing IT expense by ""Y percent.""  I've worked in companies that (a long time ago) dropped maintenance on the fault-tolerant, redundant components to make budget because the boss' bonus depended on hitting ""the number.""  Half the infrastructure went uncovered.

Fast forward to today and a similar dynamic is playing out with Cybersecurity budgets.

First change that has to happen: Get cybersecurity out from under IT in budget and leadership.  IT leaders are rated on up time (availability) and functionality.  If increased up time and functionality introduces new risk, so be it.   Conflicts of interest arise too easily.

So, every company needs a CISO that is a peer to the CIO.  CISOs determine risk, and the costs to mitigate the risk.  If a conflict arises, the CEO or COO can make the impartial, ""what's good for the business"" decision.

The CEOs must face consequences of budgeting decisions that don't address cyber risks.  Granted, no one will approve a $2million project to mitigate a $500,000 security risk.  But failing to fund a $200K project to mitigate a $10million risk should cost the decision maker.  And I'm talking about losing golden parachutes as well as the job. This will probably force the realization that operating a business heavily dependent upon data costs far more than the current models realize.  Under the current model, the CIO risks losing their job and bonus approaching the CEO for a 20% increase in spending.

The US has data security requirements in the Sarbanes Oxley Act.  It's a start for public companies, but it obviously does not go far enough in promoting readiness to thwart ransomware.  Data security standards that require companies to be able to restore each and every system within a certain number of days may help.

Lastly, there is no ""market"" for ransom determining the amount.  Ransoms are always what the criminals think they can get away with. As long as there is a cryptocurrency in existence, there will be ransomware."

Whether a law gets upheld is basically a matter of three factors: What does it get me if I ignore it, what does it cost to uphold it and how likely is it to get caught. Nothing else.

The same logic applies to ransomware vs. prevention. The equation is simply ""cost to prevent ransomware attack"" times ""likelihood of occurrance"" vs ""cost to pay for ransom"". If the latter becomes expensive enough, they will start securing their business.

They try to up the cost of paying. Which is a sensible idea, but this way, all this opens is a new variable in the game. The variables are ""likelihood of getting caught paying ransom"" and ""fine if we pay"". 

And finding a fine that makes sense is fairly impossible here. Too low and it gets ignored and is just another cost factor to be paid when the risk manifests.

You need people managing processes, reporting to federal regulators, conducing intelligence gathering on APTs and their TTPs, communicating the cybersecurity team's requirements to other parts of the company, managing relationships with third parties (and assessing them). The list goes **on and on and on**. You don't know what you don't know.

But wait, you *do* know all of that and then some, right? Because you have a computer science degree.

I also have a computer science degree (with honors I might add), and I can tell you that belief could not be further from the truth. You **may** have touched on secure code development in your CS program, but I very much have a hard time believing you dove deep enough into anything else under the cybersecurity umbrella to acquire an in-depth understanding on.

Another thing you seem to be stuck on is that you should get jobs ahead of people without a CompSci degree, or without any degree, who have certifications. What a moot point to be attached to-what about the people that have both?  Look, I tell people this all the time. Its easy to teach people the tools/processes a team uses in their day-to-day work. In fact, each team/company/whatever probably does things differently so it goes without saying that the new-join will have to be taught ""the way"". It is a lot harder to teach people quickly the ""language of cybersecurity"", ie, what things like *MITM* and *IoCs* and a plethora of other things actually mean.

I used quite a few acronyms in this post. Pretty simple stuff for people in cybersecurity. Did you know them all? Google anything? I don't expect you to answer that--but you know the answer.

So, step 1: lose the sense of entitlement.

Step 2: Figure out what it is you are trying to do within cybersecurity and make yourself attractive and competitive for those kinds of positions---maybe even via, gasp, certifications.

Step 3: lose the sense of entitlement. I would 10/10 hire someone who was humble and eager to learn over someone who came in thinking they had what it takes to be an executive in 2 years with no real-world experience to speak of."

Cool. It sounds like you have a good understanding of this stuff at a low-level. You would likely make a good software engineer. But if you go into an interview and they ask you to configure OSPF on a router and you start explaining how you can do it in C++ instead, you're not going to get the job. 

When I say ""implement"", I mean ""*as applicable to the job*"". The majority of cybersecurity doesn't involve much more than basic scripting. That aspect I have no doubt you'd be able to handle, but the other 90% is where I think you may have trouble.

>It's not an entitlement problem, you sound brainwashed (no offence). It's a selection problem thinking that certs are the only way to teach cyber security. Many universities have strong cybersécurity research programs and often can be selected as a specialization in the degree program.

No one is saying certs are the *only* way to teach *anything*. However, certs certainly help out quite a bit when you're starting out and don't have much experience. I said it before, but once more, degrees are often a check in a box. Regardless of how rigorous the program was. 

You don't have to *like* certs, but they will play a part in your career until you have an overwhelming amount of experience. 

As for the entitlement comment, you come off that way by essentially saying ""*I have a CS degree. I should be able to land a job in Cybersecurity*"", and then again when given the advice (from multiple people) of getting a cert, saying ""*a course I took for my degree was harder than that cert and certs aren't the only way*"". That comes off as entitled and frankly, it doesn't work that way, regardless of whether or not you think it *should*.  

If you want to work in this field, you're going to *have to* get over your hatred of certs as well as learn to actually set up, configure, and use various tools and infrastructure (not just program). If you don't, you're going to continue finding it difficult to break into this field."

Let's touch on something specific for instance, you mentioned being able to configure routers and switches. This is very basic stuff. Anyone can do that as long as they are familiar with Cisco iOS commands for Catalyst devices. However, certs like the CCNA will eventually be phased out for certs like Cisco DevNet where you configure devices and automate them with Python. 

My point is that if someone has a degree in Computer Science, they should automatically qualify for a Cybersecurity position. Most CS graduates who are applying for cybersecurity positions have obviously done intense study/lab work at the University. That is the problem I have with people who have never studied Comp Sci. They think they know what Computer Science is about, but they do not. Cybersecurity is a sub-field of Computer Science.

A lot of employers are going to want experience, and DEFINITELY are going to want certifications. 

Experience is typically general IT experience, anything from helpdesk to sysadmin.

Certifications will typically be Security+, offered by CompTia. 

Any candidate that has a certification and/or experience would likely be higher on the stack of resumes than a degree alone."
cybersecurity,nqsr3f,Breaking into the job market,pycepticus,h0en1d3,t3_nqsr3f,0,"If you are looking to get into cybersecurity, one of the easiest ways to break in is to look for an entry level security analyst position. MSSP's are pretty eager to hire fresh graduates with comp sci or cyber degrees. Pay wont be the best, but after a year or 2, you'll easily transition to an engineering or sales position, or take your experience to any number of other companies."
cybersecurity,nqsr3f,Breaking into the job market,Electrical_Quarter,h0dis5y,t3_nqsr3f,0,Do you have any certs? I saw you’re studying for security+ but do you have any networking or IT certs?
cybersecurity,nqsr3f,Breaking into the job market,Markusferealius,h0d0x4r,t1_h0chsyw,1,I want any and all input. I completed an internship and was also a work study for the colleges IT department. Im currently studying for SEC+ and plan on taking the test in July because certs are looked upon favoray by employers and understandably so.
cybersecurity,nqsr3f,Breaking into the job market,gettingtherequick,h0ghe46,t1_h0en1d3,1,"+1 for working in MSSP or SOC, likely night shifts to gain experience/exposure. Once you work in SOC for 1-2 years, pretty easy to move into other cyber roles. SOC is a grinding place with repetitive work, but a perfect starting point for newbies."
cybersecurity,nqsr3f,Breaking into the job market,Markusferealius,h0dn7yw,t1_h0dis5y,1,Not currently. Network+ is on the lost after SEC+.
cybersecurity,nqsr3f,Breaking into the job market,Electrical_Quarter,h0dqbkh,t1_h0dn7yw,2,"So I guess it depends on what you specifically want to do, but if you want to do netsec I’d recommend just going for your CCNA instead of network+. Some people want to do network+ then CCNA but if you already have some networking knowledge or experience I’d say just go for the one that qualifies you more. I say this because I’m pretty stubborn when it comes to this kind of thing. 

When I was wasting time thinking about going for my CCNA and getting encouragement from mentors and coworkers in net eng and network administrators, my manager and petty coworkers advised against going for it and told me network+ was a better “next step” and being stubborn, I took that as them telling me I couldn’t do it. I have a separate kinda bogus certification that was from a hybrid networking class I took that’s called network pro by testout that preps you for network+, so I thought why the hell would I take an exam for a certification after taking the class and learning everything I needed to take it? 

I also already work with Cisco routers switches and APs at my job so I was like fuck it I’m just gonna go for my CCNA. I’m almost done with my classes and I’m planning on taking it this year. It’s a lot of studying but I think it’s more worth the money than network+ because it just covers more and if I want to get a better job it’s going to help me not just to have the piece of paper but to understand concepts that are crucial to the positions I’m eyeing. 

What kind of job or career are you looking for? I find stalking peoples LinkedIn’s and looking at their certs and experience gives me a good idea of what I need in order to get where I want to be. Sometimes you can get away with not having all the certs if you can land a position that allows you to gain the experience necessary and be able to nail an interview without BSing anything."

From there, for example if you wanted to explore like network security you could go for your CCNA or another Cisco cert (like if you wanted to go specifically for a certain type of netsec like wireless) or if you wanted to pen test you could continue on Comptia you could get PenTest+ and so on.

Yes, the way the domain registration was handled for freenode was not entirely safe.  You basically need a lawyer in order to form a nonprofit with proper governance, and freenode only needed a formal organization for the domain name (their only legal asset, as all server hosting and staffing was on a volunteer basis).  To prevent this, they would have needed to form a legal entity such as a non-profit, with the assistance of a lawyer ($$$$), **at a time when whoever the domain was registered to would actually transfer ownership to the nonprofit**.  I don't know if this could have been done, maybe there is a time they could have done it.  It would have had to be done when whoever the domain was registered to  was definitely loyal to the project.  That way, when the rest of the volunteers ask them to transfer it to the nonprofit, they would.  If the relationship was starting to sour already, asking them to sign on the dotted line would simply kick off this takeover that much sooner.  What they needed was for the FOSS pro bono lawyer community (which is necessary for anything FOSS to deal with legalities) to be involved LONG before anyone thought this was going to be an issue.

If you mean true end-to-end encryption the server doesn't have keys to - when you are in a channel of 2,000 people, you would need their 2,000 public keys, and your session key (if not the message itself) would need to be sent 2000 times (once with each key).  The server will need to relay them separately to each client, increasing bandwidth usage.  Also, if you're using session keys, sending the RSA-encrypted AES key along with each copy of the message, you're eating away at the character count if you want to keep messages in one packet for each recipient (1500 byte MTU).  So you could even end up with 4,000 packets where IRC would have sent one.

They should have formed a legal entity like a nonprofit with a board - trusting ANY individual too much is a mistake.  Libera is using a swedish nonprofit with a board to own their domain name.

christel and Andrew Lee wrote a sales contract to sell the ""network"", which is misleading.

Cancel culture is more about people who seek out enemies to eliminate than about people who refuse to associate with people they don't like.  For example, a person who no longer likes a singer that said something offensive and stops buying their music, is not part of the cancel culture problem.  Cancelling is when they decide that his career needs to end, nobody else should be able to listen to him either, and he shouldn't be able to make more music.  Or, for an IRC example - banning someone from your channel isn't cancel culture.  Joining channels you have no interest in, for the sole purpose of telling the mods ""look what this person did on my channel, you and everyone else need to ban them too!"" would be cancel crap.

I had a dozen tickets, some related to K8s and OpenShift, some relating to failed DB migrations, and so on, and some so long-running that it undoubtedly took at least half an hour just to read the ticket history. Not easy stuff. But the rest of my team stepped up. I didn’t get a single message about my stuff while I was out for nearly a week. 

When I came back, several of my tickets had been resolved, and the ones that weren’t pending customer responses had had meaningful progress made by my colleagues.

There was a 3 man sysadmin team at that place (government), someone got sick and my company provided tech staff, so they sent me at the drop of a hat to fill in to save a contract breach, as i was the most promising of the junior techs and they knew they were sending me to a what the other techs referred to as 'Hell'. We were desktop techs and this was a multidomain forest where I had to jump from desktop tech to High level Sysadmin/Data-center Manager/Dev-ops and a few other hats. 

it was a complete sink or swim moment, but my mentor hard carried me through, and got me up to speed on so many thing so fast, by week two they told the staffing company not to bother sending the previous guy back, they were sticking with me. He taught me a lot of what i knew, and showed me how to learn more. I am forever in his debt.

Around 2017 or so, most of our 3-4yr experience just.... vanished.  I think we lost half a dozen people totaling 20yrs experience in about three months.  Gutted us, as we'd just hired 18 brand new people a few months prior, so we were basically starting 2018 with a staff almost entirely brand new.  Assigning mentors was difficult, because there weren't really any experienced mentors left, so not only did I try to do my regular job of keeping the train on the tracks, but I was helping nearly everybody, daily, with actual hard nerd problems.  For 2018 to mid 2019... it was... challenging.  Lost a lot of sleep, a lot of hair.  After that things smoothed out a bit and as I assigned more tasks to people, they started turning into rockstars.

Right before Thanksgiving in 2019, my boss straight up told me ""For that vacation you've got coming up, zero email, zero work phone.  I'll pull the records from Verizon if I have to, but I demand that you actually relax for this vacation.""  I did have a bit of panic, but we all figured out which 3-4 people would be the primary contacts and my boss agreed to tackle anything really wild that came up.  I set a nice thorough out-of-office alert on my email and took off.

No calls at all, no texts.  I had to check my phone every night just to make sure the thing hadn't died on me.  I came back to the usual overflowing mailbox, but as I followed through the threads, everything had been resolved.  For the longest time, it felt like I was barely keeping the dept together by sheer willpower, and now the new folks had shown they were all willing and able to step up and shoulder the load instead of just being ""the new kids in engineering.""

Right now our DR and roll back plan is to take nightly snapshots in AWS of 1 server in each cluster then replicate it to another region keeping 2 backups via aws backup.

Also because the servers are built by hand and then cloned, when we decommission then, we take a final AMI in case we need to bring it back. The snapshots and AMIs as you can see add up

So I'm working on converting all that to terraform and ansible playbooks. By making it IAC and config management, I now only need to make sure my code is in github, the database is backed up, and the components that make up the developer's CI/CD.

sysadmin,nr4zqn,Let’s be honest about all of the “hacks” lately.,eNomineZerum,h0fwxz1,t3_nr4zqn,0,"I would like to say the F100 I worked at was a mess, it certainly was, but not so much for security.

Working on that team we tried. Endpoint agents, VPNs, Proxies, Firewalls, SIEM/SOAR with a full proactive SOC team, we got hit small time with some old Ransomware and our internal red team reverse engineered it and decrypted the few servers hit before it was caught.

We also had tools in place to daily scan for backdoor admin accounts that may have been created. A user could only get local admin for 24 hours after a senior VP had approved it. Shit was heavily segmented and siloed as well so even though I daily needed access to GPOs I still had to wait for the AD team to review and implement.

I mean, it wasn't 100% locktight, nothing ever can be when you exist in most countries across the globe and all that jazz, but we darn sure tried.

I can give the company that. It moved like the Titanic and did a lot of stuff that caused me to leave, but damn if they weren't working on putting so much armor on that ship that it would blow through any iceberg it hit.

FWIW my gen 7 i7 ""developer laptop"" idled at over 40% CPU due to the various monitoring and security tools every team put on there. There were always 2, and often times more, ways to do something because everyone had these tools."
sysadmin,nr4zqn,Let’s be honest about all of the “hacks” lately.,JohnWickBOFH,h0em85a,t3_nr4zqn,0,"Bring on the downvotes!

The US Government uses NSL's to force companies to install back doors, and other countries like the EU or China or Russia have similar mechanisms.  In the US, we use warrant canaries to assure services but they don't always work.

We know this factually about the US ever since Snowden leaked this very thing and the 2016 NSA toolkit leak and the recent one due to solarwinds.  Right after that you see a whole bunch of SEV9\\10's leak out and get patched overnight.  Everyone always says ""We'll there's tons of holes in software they just hire black hats to find them"" no they tell the companies to get their brightest on the clock to put in something that's hard to spot.  Not that many kinds of exploits are not hard to find, but we know from research finding usable exploits is a full time job to find a good ones a year in FAANG\\enterprise grade code.  This is why Solarwinds was a *supply chain attack;* the ownership orchestrated the attack.  

The cat and mouse game you get with foreign APT's is to find those backdoors and stockpile them.  The reason MS and other companies have tried to push for auto-updating as their ""responsability to secure their services"" so heavily is because it allows them to switch out exploits quickly in an operating theatre and if you can do that you can always maintain root privelages.

Read any cybersecurity insurance contract, they all have war clauses.  If the exploits or code used are tied to a government's military in any way, they don't pay.  See Maersk v Zurich over notpetya.  What those insurance contracts effectively do is eliminate your risk if and only if the attacker cannot be identified or if it's a small beans outfit that happened to find a noice exploit and use it.  As time goes on, insurance companies are increasingly motivated to find out who and get solid reporting from osint sources.

Auditors at the big 4 and insurance brokers know this, they tell management about this, and their choice right now is to not properly secure anything because fact is, security has no ROI.  The fundemental problem is most orgs don't know how to value architecture and even if they did have fantastic architecture that could be secured most staff don't care about doing it right because they're just there for their paycheck that week.  Architecture generally takes personal investment of staff in the company to figure out what works best for the processes, so why invest yourself?

For as long as governments play games forcing companies to install backdoors in software, the cost of cybersecurity insurance will rise and the coverage will lapse because if the ransomware vendors know you have insurance, they are very motivated make quality software to monetize you.  That process will take a few more years to play out and as it does, companies will continue to run into major problems when Peggy in accounting clicks on all the sabotage buttons she gets in e-mail that don't quite fit her cybersecurity training.

I'd give the life of cybersecurity insurance about 2-3 more years.  The people doing the hacking are smart, they knew targeting SMB's would create a market for insurance that the insurance companies can't win.  The insurance companies know they can make a buck for a little while but it's a yearly renewal policy and they can always jack the price.

Security is fundementally an architectural problem, and if you can get the right architecture in place and enforce it, you can effectively secure an enterprise.  The problem is politically, secure companies can't be embezzled or defrauded, thus sales guys walking into the org and managers stealing off the side are very much so motivated to weaken IT security thus all the fuckery you see in the c-suite when it comes to this BS.

When management wants you to ""own"" a problem, ask them if you solve the problem and make or save them a million bucks, what your take is because owners generally get to keep their profits.  You're here to make the blinkey lights pretty, don't invest a ton of time into anything that doesn't have a personal ROI.

There are SO many things an org can do to secure their environments for free or very little money that are just neglected because they require a bit of effort or some level of buy off from the org… Honestly, InfoSec departments rely on 6 figure products for way too much. Some off the top of my head examples:

LAPS

Enabling local firewalls to remove lateral movement and block living off the land binaries from accessing the internet. Network segmentation in general is something that most orgs can do a way better job of and they typically already own the gear to make it happen. Also your internal servers do not need access to the Internet. Block that. Treat the exceptions as exceptions and only allow what is specifically required. 

Applocker to prevent unauthorized binaries from running in user writable locations 

Heavily using delegation of authority to right size admin rights instead of using domain admin. Then restrict domain admin to only being able to login to domain controllers. Obviously having separate accounts and systems for admin functions. A simple terminal server that you remote into with an admin account where you use firewalls to heavily secure admin interfaces to only that term server…

Setting up “pass phrase” policies and preventing bullshit like Summer21 as passwords. 

Setting up proper logging and alerting with things like WEF and Graylog. Putting in real thought and effort on what normal logs look like and alerting on abnormal. For example, if there are not alerts triggered when there is a logon from a DA account there really should be.

Patch your shit, yo. That includes OS, application, and firmware. 

Disable the garbage: old smb, llmnr, wpad, ntlmv1, etc. Enable smb signing. 

Control the engagement by using deception to trick attackers into giving away their presence https://youtu.be/tIdS8nR8830

ADFS to enable SAML wherever possible. 

Some small spends:

Anixis (now part of netwrix) gives incredible control over password policies. Knock out all of the ridiculous nonsense

Enterprise Password Vaults that can automate resetting critical passwords on a regular basis and control access to those passwords are incredibly valuable. PasswordState by clickstudios is insanely cheap. Note they did just have a supply chain breach. Fwiw, they caught that breach real fast. If that makes you uncomfortable SecretServer from Thycotic is fantastic though pricey. 

MfA can be had dirt cheap if you don’t already have a solution. Entrust IdentityGuard is being practically given away. It is nowhere near as nice as something like Okta or DUO but it gets the job done. 


I could go on and on and on. The challenge I love to give InfoSec leaders is this:

Commit to implementing a security relevant change every week. Some big, some small. Doesn’t matter. Just keep the ball moving.

sysadmin,nr4zqn,Let’s be honest about all of the “hacks” lately.,night_filter,h0fqs2x,t3_nr4zqn,0,"Really there are 3 types of security:

* Security theater: You do things that may not be effective, but the purpose is really to make people feel like you have good security.
* Perfunctory security: You do what you need to in order to satisfy some official requirement, whether it's legal compliance or remediating an audit finding, but don't really care if it's effective or makes sense.
* Real security: You analyze what you're trying to protect and the likely attackers, and you develop a model for decreasing the likelihood that an attacker will be successful in an attack, or will get away with an attack without consequences, or will at least be noticed if an attack.  Match the level of protection and response to the value of what is being protected.

The third one is hard.  It takes though and attention and work, and a relatively small oversight could compromise your security model.  Plus, a lot of your work is likely to go unnoticed by people who aren't paying attention because a lot of the best security is superficially transparent-- authorized people can get access without a lot of hassle.  As a result, almost nobody really does real security.

And yes, a lot of compromises that hit the news would be prevented if companies generally had competent security professionals, and the companies were willing to invest in real security.  They don't, and that's unlikely to change."

I can’t even implement modern tools with modern controls because security has to “evaluate” them per-version, which takes 9-15 months, by which point a new version has released and we start the process over.  We can’t use most m365 services so we used Zoom at the beginning of the wfh pandemic instead of Teams, which we already had fully licensed.

My favorite example was when our most-secure, highest-regulation service was looking to create a cloud instance as disaster recovery.  The “security” team that owns Azure implemented global rules to treat everything like this most-protected service because everything in Azure is the same.  That team had one meeting with the security team and said “nah, there’s no way we are following all that BS” and then proceeded to purchase *their own* cloud solution and manage it themselves.  Now the rest of the company has to follow all of these ridiculous rules and regulations for Azure use while the product those rules were designed for just peaced out.

Meanwhile we have to deploy Java to all workstations with config files that open up all of the vulnerabilities because “security” has tools that are running on Server 2003 that they believe they absolutely require."

Equifax was a combination of phished creds and laziness of whomever was in charge in its Argentina offices, where that weak link brought down everything else.

Then there are companies who don't patch their software, don't update their equipment firmware, don't take steps to address access control / permissions, don't conduct user training, etc and are just begging to get hit.

At least in the US it's probably going to take legislation that formalizes something like OSHA for cybersecurity, where meeting minimum standards is required by law. Things like PCI / NIST 800-171 / pen testing are mostly still optional or market-driven standards but don't really have teeth or the force of law yet.

I also believe that we should implement a great deal of the technical aspects people are calling out here. 

The real issue is that the attackers have zero risk, relatively speaking, and the possibility of a great reward. A Russian kid in his mom’s basement is very unlikely to be extradited to the US (or any country) for a failed attack. But if he is successful, then he can disappear and retire.

We can implement all the security we want, but if a user can open the front door as it were then what we do doesn’t really matter. We can talk about educating users all day but that is unlikely to work because it only takes a small lapse in judgment and poof all that education doesn’t matter.

The easy (but not good solution) would be to control access Internet on a national level (maybe with some treaties as the exception). There might be other ideas out there, so please share if you have a better idea. I hate this idea, but I haven’t heard of another that actually fixes the issue.

I worked for a company years and years ago that hired offshore “software developers” to make the web application that ran their whole business. I found so many fucked up security holes. For example, the random session ID key in URLs that displayed after you logged in wasn’t random at all - that shit was hard-coded in the PHP script so that it looked like a random string, but was identical for everybody. 
Once you realized this, you could log in as any other user by just changing the user parameter in the URL. 

Their password reset form also required no email confirmation, and had no timeout between attempts, so you could just spam password resets against a list of all users if you felt like making a script for it. 

There was a PHP form for uploading images, but of course the code didn’t actually validate that what you were uploading was an image (and you didn’t even need to be logged in to do it if you knew the URL).

If you mean OS version, then that might not be possible or desirable. For example, Palo Alto released version 9.1.8 on 10/FEB/2021 and then 9.1.9 on 08/APR/2021 and even then, updating to the very latest for the sake of running the very latest code could introduce stability issues as major bugs have been found after release.   
There are support recommended releases for a reason and many people follow those unless the latest version or major release version includes features you wish to take advantage of.

  
If it's dynamic updates that include things such as threat and virus signatures, URL filtering entries, and AppIDs then I'd hope you're doing those more frequently than once a month. Though it is worth remembering that if you're using the layer 7 features of a firewall such as Palo Alto, then an AppID or URL filtering category update can cause traffic to be blocked until you address the changes, you just need to be strong when someone inevitably whinges that ""it's ridiculous that something I used to have access to is now getting blocked"".   
They don't know or care that it isn't an intentional attack on them and that it's just what can happen if you're very prescriptive in what you allow through and something that was being picked up as ""web-browsing"" (allowed via URL filtering policy) before is now it's own AppID and hitting your default block rule."

sysadmin,nr4zqn,Let’s be honest about all of the “hacks” lately.,sonofdavidsfather,h0gcyh2,t1_h0est5h,2,"The one disagreement I have with this is the ""IT due diligence"".  Yes IT need to do that, but the rest of the organization needs to do their sue diligence as well.  

The employees need to actually read emails from IT and report anything suspicious.  All 3 places I have worked IT have had some sort of breach that affected multiple systems/users.  Each and everyone was traced back to an employee making a mistake that had previously been covered in multiple trainings and emails.  The worst is when the specific issue has already been identified, so we send an email and post notices warning the users, and they still do it.  Which brings us to the next part.

Management needs to do their part which begins with holding employees accountable for doing their part.  Training campaigns can be torpedoed real quick by a manager that doesn't take it seriously, and therefore doesn't ensure their people are taking it seriously.  The management has to support IT in creating a security conscious culture.

The management also needs to allow IT to have the resources to do their part.  First they need to provide the funding to have the products that are needed to secure the network and train the employees on doing their part.  Second they need to provide the payroll to have enough employees to do the work.  At a previous employer we kept get account breaches for users so we implemented multifactor authentication.  After a year we were at maybe 20% simply due to the fact we didn't have enough people to actually get with the users and help get things setup.  Third they need to lead by example.

The reason I make such a big point out of this is because at each of these 3 organizations I was constantly confronted with the ""it's technology so it is ITs problem not mine"" attitude.  If the organization as a whole does not take their IT security responsibilities seriously then it doesn't matter how seriously IT takes it or of they did their due diligence.  

Insurance companies need to take this in to account.  It would be in everyone's best interests.  Step one would be to look at the IT Security training that is provided to the employee base, the completion rate of the training, and actually crunch the numbers to look at the effectiveness of the training.  An example, at a 3-400 employee organization I worked for, was 1 user who always had to be reminded multiple times to complete the training with each email having their supervisor cc'd, who got phished multiple times a year, and always complained IT needed to get their act together.  She was a shining example of how the management above her and the organization as a whole did not care about being secure."

The reality is (at least based on my anecdotal experience) people have become a lot more technologically aware and security conscious in the past 15 years.

I was there for like a year and we went through three or four developers in that time. The first set of developers were the original builders of the application, and I dealt with them the most. For a while I had daily calls with the developers to try to hold them to account, because they would often say that an issue was fixed, and I’d demonstrate that it was not fixed during the call. They would just straight-up lie to me so I had to fact check everything. 

For the password reset issue, I edited the site myself to remove that function and added a note to email an administrator for a password reset. 

The URL token issue was even worse - they “fixed” the issue by removing the hard-coded random string, so it didn’t display any more, but didn’t replace it with actual security. Their fix was literally just to remove the fake security and replace it with nothing, as if the string itself was the problem. I don’t think they ever properly implemented secure session tokens while I was there.

I couldn’t get any buy-in from my bosses to push the developers to fix the arbitrary file upload issue, because they couldn’t really grasp why that was an issue. Same thing with some XSS vulnerabilities I found. It was too abstract for them, so they just wanted me to focus on driving the devs to make the software actually work before focusing on security (oh yeah, the whole software was a pile of shit and barely worked, being constantly edited in production while hundreds of users relied on it every day).

Use either the built-in reporting or external log analysis tools to see what your rules are letting through and whether you need to make changes to either better aid that flow or to logically make more sense to you.

There's two layers of problem here.

The car, it's fairly obvious what you want to achieve.  Lights, indicators, wipers, gears - you can see immediately that you've done the right thing, and the symbols to do so are simple line drawings that are standardised across manufacturers.  Microsoft, on the other hand, realised that the ""Start"" menu didn't have to be set in stone after XP and have been messing around with it ever since.

There aren't a great many extraneous buttons - virtually everything in the car has a purpose, its purpose is well-known and well-understood.

The PC, by contrast, has buttons (icons) that move around, can be rearranged by someone without so much as a by-your-leave and might look totally different next week.  And probably a heck of a lot more icons than the user actually needs.

If you've never mentally abstracted the icon from what you want to achieve - which a lot of people don't - then any change to either the icon or its location is likely to cause all sorts of issues.

The second layer of problem is the consequence if you mess it up.  There's an awful lot of power-tripping middle managers that love to dangle the threat of being fired over their staff's head.

The consequence of this is that much of their working life is in a state of almost constant stress.  This machine has different icons in radically different places to theirs at home and they behave differently to what they're used to.  It has been dropped in their lap and their manager just dropped a not-so-subtle hint that they should ""stop playing around on their computer and get back to work"".

I used to read that national constitutions were modeled on the United States Constitution, and I assumed that included explicit enumeration of individual rights. Actually, what it always meant was the tripartite [Separation of Powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers).

Reading national constitutions is an eye-opener. For example, in the 1979 constitution of modern Zimbabwe, every individual right is explicitly limited by the exigency of the government. ([Chapter VIII, 128.](https://www.ifes.org/sites/default/files/con00006.pdf)) Turns out that document has been replaced since the last time I looked it up, and the 2013 constitution seems less chilling."

In France we had (so far) three quarantine periods: early 2020 (full quarantine), late 2020 (soft quarantine) and early 2021 (softer quarantine)

Learning from the first two, a budget was authorized to get 25 laptops for trainees (they had to work on personal hardware the first time, it was a mess). Our trainees come in waves in January and July and the last wave was particularly numerous (25 trainees hired instead of the usual 15)

I've coordinated the last 6 trainee waves and I know for a fact that we can expect at best 10%, at worse 20% or more of the previous wave to either be hired or pop out of nowhere at the last minute for a second round.

So we had to fight tooth and nail to get an additional 10 PCs, with both our management and our IT consultant protesting the decision.

Lo and behold, we expected 13 trainees a month ago. We are now preparing for 19 new trainees and counting with only a few days between the departure of the last wave and arrival of the next, with a new one being announced just this morning and an unconfirmed number of current trainees being hired in the next 4 weeks. 

Plus, 7 laptops were broken last month, two are currently being repaired by Lenovo in another country and one of them is on it's way out. 

Management is sick and tired of me yelling every six months about ""procedure"", ""supply chain"" and ""deployment time"", so they keep expecting me to shit out fully configured laptops in less than 24 hours while being outraged at the hardware budget being doubled in the las 12 months.

Background: We're a team of 5 generalists who rotate through all the jobs on a weekly basis. At any given time 3/5 are dedicated to helpdesk duties.

So the plan is: 

Helpdesk Prime and Secondary: In the office 0830-1630  
Helpdesk Tertiary: Work from home, 1230-2030 (we added this ""late shift"" last year as WFH tended to shift people's working hours. Not to mention the 65,000 members we support who could be working 24x7).  
""Projects"" (ie: not responsible for answering the phone): From home if you can, in the office if you need to be.

So, at the end of the day, I'll be going back 40%. I was hoping for 20% (I think there's a benefit to having the person responsible for answering the phone/e-mail not being able to have someone walk up and grab them, skipping any queue), buy was expecting it to be 80%.

Being that I live 120km from the office, I like the lower number.

I think IT is going to end up having to go back at least part-time unless the IT people are attached to product groups designing products. Companies consider IT too much of a utility to not have bodies n the office.

That said, I think it's completely unnecessary. I never want to see the inside of an office again. I know the extroverts of the world want to have their water coolers and their preschool decor and their open space for ""happy accident collaboration time."" Big tech companies that sell the all-inclusive, on-campus lifestyle are going to be hard-pressed to give that up. Google is forcing everyone back as is Netflix, Microsoft is partially allowing remote work, it's all over the map. For non-tech companies, I'm pretty sure the middle managers are going to force everyone back after whispering into the CxO's ear about their ""disengaged"" remote workforce. Even in flat organizations there are just too many managers whose sole job is to babysit physical spaces and make sure their humans are producing.

In my case, I would have to quit my job long-term if forced back to the office. I switched jobs during COVID for a ""city"" job and live about 60 miles away from New York. The train/subway commute is an absolute beast 5 days a week, almost 3 hours door to door. If forced I would do one or two days...maybe...but I just don't see why. Why do I have to get on the train and show up in the office just to do the same stuff I've been doing from home with a 30 second commute?

I just wish we could find something useful for all the babysitter middle managers out there to do and still get paid...I think that would be the only way to get 100% remote work long-term...because you know they're going to start seeding the business press with articles/studies about productivity and collaboration and such.

Okay.  So they will have to bring things back and forth, or choose what to bring back and forth.  Maybe they leave dock and monitor at work and just move the laptop.  Or the other way around.

I'm not really sure what the big deal is aside from sort of a silly email.  I mean, obviously you can't magically make additional equipment.  So the alternative is to have them move the equipment you do have back and forth.  Or, you could have shared work spaces I guess in order to make what equipment you may have usable in that regard.


Maybe this stuff just doesn't get me worked up when it's something like this that is clearly impossible.  Like, a decision that is a bad decision when there are other options drives me crazy.  But as you said, you can't shit out technology.  So what they want is literally impossible (the equipment piece... going back and forth is totally possible).

They had an occupational health officer who could check for all kinds of safety hazards regularly.

We had a pretty big IT storage room with testing benches, cages for checking in and out equipment etc, desktop guys would image/build/repair machines, sysadmins had a mini lab for testing etc.

It was messy, no matter how many times I asked the guys to clean up there would be motherboards, NICs, and empty cases all over the place a day later, nothing serious, just typical 20ish year old IT guys being lazy and messy, certainly nothing dangerous.

Occupational health had a keycard which they could access that room, and every single time we'd have a report saying there are a bunch of hazards in there.

Pissed me off because it was just nonsense from someone with no clue justifying their job, saying things like computer cases being left open (not plugged in) are an electrical hazard, tools being left on the bench are a hazard etc.

I asked my director can we just cut off their access to the IT storage room, they have no need to be in there and there is a security compliance rule about datacenters/network closets only being accessed by IT staff, technically we can declare this a server room, he said sure go ahead.

Next time they tried to access it and denied, they placed a ticket and I gladly replied ""yeah sorry we MUST follow these guidelines and nobody aside from IT can access this room"".

I don’t know if it’s a communication issue due to time and/or language, a management issue due to distance, a cultural issue, or if the contractors straight up lied about their capabilities. Usually it seems like a combination of all of the above. 

In my experience its the ""all of the above"".  I'll also add in for organizations that are not already used to dealing with global staff: the challenges of time zones.

The biggest sin that I usually see happen is that orgs are perusing outsourcing to seek lowest costs.  There are most certainly high quality offshore engineers, but you're not getting them for bargain basement prices.

One other tactic I've seen is that an offshore contracting org will have an ""A team"" that is extremely qualified, presentable, and communicates well that they'll use to land the engagement.  Once the papers are signed you'll see the ""B team"" show up slowly until one day you realize the entire A team is gone and your experience and end result is NOT what you thought you were getting at the beginning."

Of course India being cheaper also helped.  


Before the pandemic hit I was meant to travel to a few sites in India to do security assessments and judge if we could use them, but my VP gave me a rundown on the things he saw, cracked software everywhere, consumer TPlink/netgear type of routers at the egde, unmanaged switches, no active directory, no permissions on their file server, no CCTV, no physical security keycards, the list went on.

The HR VP was later ""let go"" after a disastrous HRIS migration which caused loss-of-coverage for health insurance for the entire company (and even with retroactive coverage, it was a motherfucker).

The fun part was that they went from ADP to Namely. ADP let you book future time off if you were going to have that time accrued when the date in question rolled around. They bollocksed up the migration so that any vacation that was approved in ADP would be autoapproved in Namely - but without it counting against future unearned PTO, _and cancelling the vacation would refund the time allotted for the vacation back to your PTO balance._

I'll give you a hint as to how that worked. 

I earned 6 weeks of PTO a year, and I booked two weeks off in October, but I only had a few days available at the time. Never fear, I'd have it by November, but right now I only had 32 hours.

They then did the migration, keeping the balances the same, and approved all vacations immediately... without counting it against future PTO. That meant that my 32 hours stayed, but I gained 5 days of PTO because I booked it well ahead of time, and Namely and the HR VP assumed I'd had the balance.

When I cancelled the vacation, because I was quitting, I ended up with 160 hours of PTO in total (I'd earned all but 20 of it by then). The fuckers wouldn't pay out anything over 40, citing company policy and Texas law, and they wouldn't let me donate it to anyone either."

So, I get on the phone and join the queue (estimated wait time is 59 minutes -- hmmm.

The call disconnects just as I'm about to ask for escalation to a more senior person...  I waited 'til the next day, before trying again.

3. Profile Computer
4. Make sure you have new user's address
5. Pack and ship all equipment for new users starting the following Monday

Add in the fact that you get ""last minute"", then on packing/shipping day, you have to not only pack and ship another set of equipment you weren't expecting, but also create their account, potentially image a new computer if one isn't imaged and waiting, and then profile it."

If all HR knows is that it takes a week for an account to be created, and thus the new employee won't be able to work for a week if they start that day, it sometimes gives the bean counters the necessary kick in the right direction.

I've had many surprise starters sprung on me and upon asking 'so where are they sitting?' received an '...errrrr' from their boss. Account creation is a script that takes 30 seconds. It's the rest of the process that needs that week's padding to ensure things actually align."
sysadmin,nqjc2f,Return to Office Horror Stories,kschmidt62226,h0c99uv,t1_h0bcywj,4,"I can't speak to this particular situation, but as far as taking a long time to create an account:  

I worked in Access Management at a hospital whose name everyone would recognize.  They had, over time, acquired other hospitals/clinics/etc.  This amounted to me having to learn over 100 separate systems.  Any given new doctor/nurse/employee may need an account on 10+ systems.  If there's IT ""fires"" or a backlog, you just can't start creating the account when the ticket comes in.  Sometimes, it's can also just be about the SLA:  You get a week to setup an account so nobody can complain for a week, giving you time to play the daily ""tetris"" game with your schedule that is frequently part of IT.

That same hospital provided me a spreadsheet of over three hundred (300) new nursing students, complete with usernames/passwords, and all the fields I would need to script this out in  AD through PS.  Because I wasn't a ""SysAdmin"" -my title was 'Access Management'- I wasn't allowed access to PowerShell.  My manager tried, but they refused.  I spent the next few days **manually** entering over 300 nursing students - from one school of nursing.  There were several more Schools of Nursing I had to setup.  This happened every semester.

EDIT:  This was only the AD accounts, not the other systems to which they'd need access.  Also, I didn't deal with issuing equipment.  This is the way it can get in larger environments.

EDIT #2:  Someone suggested that I have the team that possessed PowerShell access to run a script and create these account for me.  Here's my reply to /u/mimic751: ""I already wrote the script.  When they denied me access to PowerShell, I asked if they could run the script with the CSV themselves.  Their response:  ""No!""  I asked: ""Why not?""  They replied: ""Creating new user accounts is your job.""  You can't make this crap up."

And office/teams needs some time for synchronisation, so at the VERY LEAST (if no other things are scheduled) we need 24 hours. 

But yeah, we had a few times where we were supposed to get laptops back from people that left us, but the franchise managers were too late with bringing the laptops back. Which resulted in someone else not having a laptop on time because we also couldn't arrange anything because we simply didn't have ANY stock left. If we heard it on time we could give the franchise managers another call telling them we NEED the laptops, so the laptop could at least be shipped on time. 

tl;dr: in a perfect world we can get a user fully setup in 24 hours. Often it isn't a perfect world so we like to give ourselves a bit of breathing room, hence a week up front."

If HR tells us 2 days upfront we can still arrange it, IF we don't have any other scheduling issues. But we might not have the stock, or the manpower to get it arranged. 

When we went full laptops we had a delay of several months simply because HP couldn't deliver the laptops due to the chip shortage. I told management way ahead that we'd have shipping problems and that we HAD to order a few laptop for stock, because just having 3 for a company of 200 people won't work.

We actually did some work in a location that had exposed high voltages, and an elaborate interlock system. There was one key: it either went into the door, or into the circuit breaker - it was not possible to open the door without switching off the voltage.

Even then though, policy was that we basically go into that area only in arms reach of a qualified technician. It was both about the risk of injury, and the risk of us touching something that we didn't know about and damaging their equipment. We in IT never touched that key, but we were shown the process by the head of safety in that department, and you can bet I was not going to let that key (or the tech holding it) leave my sight when I was working in there.

This place was huge on CYA, and honestly, I didn't mind.

To be fair I knew how to fix most of them, but that’s because I’m a tinker and a jack of all trades. None of that was something I learned because of my IT background. Some of those I pushed back because I didn’t want to deal with it.

Power had already been out for about 45 minutes and my UPS’s had long since died. I told them there was nothing I could do. That’s where I was apparently wrong. They wanted me to run to the hardware store and get a long extension cord and run power from their car to power up the server, their printer, and desktop. Mind you it’s pouring down rain and a 3 block radius has no power. Had no desire to do that whatsoever. Not to mention that it would never work. I told them that the build in power inverter in their car isn’t strong enough to power a server, printer, and computer, plus the networking equipment we needed back up. Their inverter was 300W, which would barely power the server. We did a rough measurement and we also would have needed to get close to 300 feet of extension cord, which would have had its own problems.

Last job had a idiot team lead. I managed to keep up with him for a couple years, then the IT director changed and it was also a malicious PC idiot. They told me to leave my office and work in an open space, and I refused (law was in my side) for a year, until I got tired of their mismanagement over people and projects...

Wife was also very unhappy with her job and in risk of dying of an heart attack... Told her to fire herself, I served my resignation letter a day before her, much  to her surprise, and we went in vacations to several countries in Asia.

sysadmin,nrjr8k,"""Crippling"" Ransomware Attacks and",nicenic,h0heq4n,t3_nrjr8k,0,"Postmortems would be super helpful but seem to be extremely rare.  I feel like some admin are too quick to dismiss other breaches as stupid mistakes that couldn't affect them.  They must not have had multifactor enabled, or probably had RDP open to the world... You use multifactor but do you regularly audit to make sure every account has multifactor enabled all the time and at some point someone didn't ""temporarily"" disable it. Are you sure you know all your devices on the network and they are all patches and have your security solutions and an old vm didn't get turned on or something connected..

I think there is a bit to learn from Equifax. Equifax could say we have IDS/IPS, we scan our network for vulnerabilities and do all sorts of security things. They could have potentially been reading about other breaches and been like that wouldn't happen to us because we do such and such or have such and such. Multiple failures were involved with the breach.  They wrote a signature to detect the struts exploit but their SSL cert expired and the TAP couldn't decrypt the traffic. They sent out notices to admins to patch struts but the admin of the compromised servers was relatively new and wasn't part of that mailing list. They had a team that scanned the network for the struts vulnerability but missed these servers, possible because they used vhosts and they needed the domain name and scanning IPs wasn't enough... I think there was a lot to learn from this. With all the security measures you take how are you sure things are working as expected, maintained, not being overlooked...


Just because an entry point was an account without multifactor or an exposed RDP server, what went wrong after that? Maybe the next breach will have a different entry point but how can it be hindered and detected before the entire network is compromised...


It would be nice to see more postmortems but I think companies are reluctant because so many just want to pounce on the mistakes."

It's a risk that some of them may choose to hear what they want to hear, and become a problem for us. Or some may try to deal with one of us and not the other, in order to get their way.""

As for what they're planning, that's a separate, strategic matter. I suggest forcing them to make a decision one way or another, by carefully letting them know that you're being asked by others to make a commitment to another site.

Then they either make you a contract offer of some sort, or they don't, and you're architecting your smooth exit. Be extremely polite, be extremely professional, but if you want to let the novice hang, feel free.

Remember, your professional responsibilities are to communicate issues and site-local concerns.

Young males and testosterone-driven status-seeking is a story as old as the world. Try not to take it personally. Everyone just wants [Autonomy, Mastery, and Purpose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive:_The_Surprising_Truth_About_What_Motivates_Us). Don't create a conflict unless you choose consciously to do so.

The best technique I've picked up is to use the phrase ""I feel that..."" in order to be non-authoritative and leave room to admit error, while being as objective as humanly possible in what you're actually saying.

*I feel that we probably want to be on the same page, when users ask us about X. You were filling in Muhammed back there, but he's heard something different from me. What are we going to do?*

That's probably the most convenient, most productive, and most professional route to take. You could also choose to be visibly annoyed and competitive. But if you do so, do so consciously and with planning, not accidentally and impulsively and incompetently. Either way, do it with dignity and professionalism.

If you pay attention, you'll also realize more about the situation. Some people implicitly feel under pressure to make others happy, or to have answers for everything, and will instinctively respond accordingly. Avoid being confrontational about that sort of thing, because it can tend to cause people react stubbornly and double down on their mistakes, when they otherwise wouldn't do so.

We are MFG, so we have the tools for that, you are medical though, so you may have certain requirements for proof of destruction, so your process may vary a little.

1- Do it more often so you don't have that many to do at once.  
2- A drill press is sufficient, or a press brake, or any hydraulic press.  
2a - Interns or low paid people with free time, they can always take the drives apart with a few tools and that makes it a lot easier to destroy them without major equipment.  
3- Then sell the remains for scrap.

Save all your trouble and just call a hard drive shredding company and have them do it for you, will cost between $5 and %15 per drive.

Not sure how many and how often you need to shred, but a shredder will run you probably $10k or more for a decent large volume one, so you won't be saving $$ probably til you hit the 1k-1200 mark on drive destruction, although you will get a little back from the scrap."
sysadmin,nrm2nk,Question: How much does your company pay to destroy hard drives or what is your solution?,pdp10,h0heoxz,t3_nrm2nk,0,"Paying to destroy useful hardware, stabs me in my sensibilities. Do these instead:

1. Your standard decommissioning procedure for server assets is to decomm and wipe them before they get powered off and de-racked. Your procedures confirm that this is done. (Our primary purpose for this is data management, not security, but the rule serves both purposes.) Do not separate used drives from their system until they've been decommed and wiped. Do not destroy drive sleds/carriers.
2. Use Full-Disk Encryption everywhere practical, especially outside of a secure perimeter. This ensures that even if assets are lost, or mistakes happen, that data can't be retrieved from storage devices. Even so, still wipe these at time of decomm, before returning them to inventory. LUKS on Linux, Filevault2 on macOS, Bitlocker on Windows.
3. Consider using Self-Encrypting Disk functionality in systems that support it, like storage arrays. Caveats apply -- these systems are less reliable/secure than software encryption, but can still be useful when properly employed. Mostly we would use this to self-encrypt array disks so that we could return the disks to the vendor for the warranty replacement. In many cases there's another layer of software FDE running above it.
4. Tune your ATA TRIM/SCSI UNMAP and Thin Provisioning with FDE in mind. We enable discard on FDE volumes, even though this is just a tiny bit less secure."

The issue we have is that some staff on their shifts aren't allowed to have personal mobile devices on them due to draconian management, so we've basically used Azure AD conditional access to mean that when they access Azure Resources from that particular public IP they are not required to use MFA, however from any other locations they are required to use MFA.

As well as this, they can only register their security information for MFA from a trusted IP, and are prompted to register MFA upon first access to the Office365/Azure resources.

The next step is to convince the business to purchase licenses to allow us to leverage intune so that only intune compliance devices can access azure resources.

We did begin to look into using deepnet OTP keyfobs, as they can pair in with AzureMFA, however that discussion has gone quiet due to the costs."

https://www.ldap389.info/en/2010/09/06/powershell-domain-controller-certificate-kerberos-authentication-template/

That is if you want to use the kerberos cert over the domain controller cert.

EDIT:
Domain controllers automatically request a domain controller certificate (if published) when they discover an enterprise certificate authority is added to Active Directory

In our environment we had issues as we had some apps that were doing ldaps to domain.com and not dc.domain.com. 

The domain controller cert doesn’t have a San name for domain.com 

So we had to supersede the domain controller cert with the Keebler’s cert as it has sans for dc.domain.com, domain.com, and netbios domain name.

However, if you can get Linux to boot (even if it crashes) I don't think the LEDs will tell you much as you have already past the POST process. The codes might still refer to iLO issues but I don't think they contain any information on the running system if you get through the POST.

Do you have a SOC that will be managing your SIEM? If not have you considered a SIEM that is managed by someone else?  


What is your goal or driving force behind this project?  
What is your experience with a SIEM?   
Does someone have 40+ hours per week to manage this?  
And what are your expectations, i.e. do you just want somewhere to dump all your logs and have an easy way to search all your logs without any other fancy features, do you want advanced security features that can produce visualizations and dashboards, do you want to hunt threats?  


I think these are more pertinent questions, any SIEM can be great or terrible and it is entirely based on how much effort can be dedicated to the SIEM, you can spend $500k on Splunk and have a terrible experience if you don't have the resources to manage it correctly.  
At the same time you could spend $50k on something basic like Graylog and have an amazing SIEM if there is enough resources to deal with it.

This can be done in a number of ways. Probably the most uninterruptive way is to make the change and wait for leases to expire. The computers will continue to work on the old IP addresses outside the new scope (assuming the subnet, gateway, and DNS servers are the same) and when the renewal comes around they will get a IP in the new scope.

You can also make a GPO a few days before that makes a one time scheduled task to release/renew. If you control the phone system there is more often than not an option to boot phones, there, you can just do a mass boot of the phones for those. You can boot all of the networking equipment, then boot all of the phones which should kick all of the devices on the network. This is harder if you have unmanaged switches around. You can also change the DCHP range and then issue a reboot command to all PCs in that range. This is done pretty easily with command line shutdown commands with /m to every PC in that range.

Your biggest concern should probably getting the printers reassigned and working again on all of the machines. This is going to be the biggest pain point for the users."

We will often put in a big black and white laser for general printing and a smaller mfp for colour /scanning.

For color laser MFC, prior to the pandemic lockdown, I liked the look of [Xerox WorkCentre 6515 and the Lexmark MC2535](https://reddit.com/r/printers/comments/fsh6sq/opinions_on_xerox_workcentre_6515_versus_lexmark/). At the time, I could source either one for very attractive prices. Probably they were being sold at cost, with all the profit in the consumables.

Cost per page wasn't the single most important factor at the time, because I expected page-counts on the color printers to be rather low. I was mostly concerned with overall quality, longevity in service, and nifty features beyond what you expect from every PostScript laser from the last 25 years.

I read the portions of the user manuals related to manageability features, networking, and other items of acute interest. I always recommend doing the same. I checked for updated firmware, how easy it was to get, and how frequently it had been updated.

For a long time that was my opinion as well. But historically, the first laser printers were xerographic copiers with an extra raster output connected to a computer interface. A 1972 laser printer is conceptually identical to a 2021 MFP.

You  could work for the place where  the term hacking was invented.

Requirements (for some loose definition of require, we encourage, facilitate, provide a lot of training):

* Understanding of static and dynamic software analysis tools and techniques
* Low-level understanding of how systems work
* Systems programming experience
* A great attitude, curiosity, and a willingness to learn
* US Citizenship and the ability to get a DOD TOP SECRET clearance

Nice to haves:

* Operating systems & kernel internals knowledge
* Familiarity with malware analysis techniques
* Familiarity with exploit development and testing
* Demonstrated software development skills
* Knowledge of compiler theory and implementation
* Experience with x86, ARM, PPC, MIPS, RISCV and other assembly languages
* Embedded systems experience and/or hardware RE skills
* A graduate degree (MS or PhD)

Perks:

* Work with a great team of really smart and motivated people
* Interesting, challenging, and important problems to work on
* The opportunity to work on important and challenging problems that impact the nation (we're not here to sell ads or push products - do you want  to  make some company's profits bump by 0.005% this quarter, or do you  want  to change the world?)
* Sponsored conference attendance, bountiful education and on-site training opportunities (we expect employees take 2 weeks a year of training).
* Great continuing education programs
* Relocation is required, but fully funded (though we are all mostly working from home these days).

Please PM if you are interested. HR stuff will come later, but I'd like to talk to you first, and if we seem like a match we can proceed from there. The people are brilliant, the work is challenging, and it's an   amazing place to work and take things to the next level."

*Penetration testing, SDL program development, and reverse engineering*

**REMOTE WORKING POSITIONS ARE AVAILABLE**

## Who is Casaba?

Casaba Security is a cybersecurity consulting firm based in Seattle and in business for almost two decades. The term *cybersecurity* encompasses the entire technology stack we all use on a daily basis, from the services and components to the raw data. From the mobile device in your pocket, to the desktop software and cloud services you use every day, to the mission-critical systems that power our lives, Casaba has been there to design and test security.

## What kind of work does Casaba do?

We are security advisors, engineers, and testers. From threat modeling to penetration testing to writing secure code, there are many aspects of the niche focus we call *security* that take place on a daily basis. We at Casaba work on long-term engagements building and executing security programs for our clients, and we work on short-term jobs that may span a few days or a few weeks of investigating a new cloud service, video game, mobile platform, or retail outlet. There is plenty of variety to this work, and while the field of cybersecurity itself has many niches, there is a certain amount of generalized technology knowledge that is required.

## Positions and Job Description

We have immediate openings for junior, senior, and principal security consultants. This is your opportunity to be as resourceful as you want, develop your skills, and learn from and contribute to leading software development and security testing efforts.

Can you discuss the security implications of router misconfigurations? Do you enjoy scanning and mapping networks, building tools to automate penetration testing or other tasks? If so, then we have a job for you.

Do not worry if your security skills are not as sharp as you would like. If you have a background in network administration, systems administration, or software development then we would like to talk to you.

**We're looking for - Senior Security Assessment Research Consultants**

Right now we're looking for full-time application hacking experts, and we do mean experts. Experience in finding awesome vulns during web app pentests (usually with code!) is a must (~65% of our work,) but we also end up doing a fair number of embedded devices/IoT, mobile apps, client apps, server apps, APIs, SDKs, and kernels as well. If your well-researched advisories or bug bounties show up around the web that's a really good sign. That being said, public advisories/bounties are not a requirement, we know there are plenty of good folks in the world who prefer not to publish any of their findings and we'd love to talk to all of you folks as well. We also do a bit of Reversing every now and then, so that experience helps for the occasion it arises.

**We work on hundreds of projects a year, here's what we've got going on this month and next:**

* We're hacking Java/C/Python/Kotlin/NodeJS mostly this month
* Next month we've got lots of Go APIs, Electron apps, Network traffic parsers in C, C++ embedded web apps, AOSP services in C, React native mobile apps, crypto/authN services in Java, and web services written in PHP/Java/Ruby.
* Rest of the year -- anything you can think of! It's never the same thing twice here.

**Who you might be:**

* You are an experienced application hacker. Web hacking is second nature, but perhaps so are other types of hacks (Reversing, Mobile, Client/Server, Crypto, Kernels, etc.)
* You've already done consulting, enterprise assessment work, or are always at the top of the bug bounties/CTFs for a number of years (**sorry we don't hire Junior consultants, it is our company policy.**)
* You're looking for a no BS environment where the process is optimized for getting out of your way and letting you find vulns. And you're happy to share and collaborate with the rest of the team.
* You love the flexibility of a remote work environment. Our team is fully remote across seven countries in North America, EU, and South America.
* You want to work with a low overhead team with no micro management, but also get to work with some heavy hitting big name clients (hundreds of clients served at this point) You want to work on assessments of the best and brightest tech companies of Silicon Valley, SF, and the world. Cutting edge technologies and massive scale systems, these are the types of engagements you dig and look for.
* You know work is important but plenty of time off and paid research time matters too. Depending on your past research experience you might end up doing four to eight weeks of non-billable research yearly. All consultants get four weeks paid time-off every year, national holidays, and the last week of every calendar year off.

**Who we are:**

We're an all expert boutique consulting company who have served hundreds of clients since our founding in 2010. We do this with a relaxed remote working environment where we can expertly hack on big name clients such as large websites, software companies, hardware companies, as well as tons of start-ups you've heard of. We do our best to put a different spin on the InfoSec/AppSec consulting game as we put our consultants and clients first and foremost! That means work on your own schedule, work from wherever you want(we've had people submit RCE findings while camping in the French Alps), and we only work with self-directed and responsible senior consultants who consistently show professional results (pay is based on that kind of experience.)

You're right up our ally if you're currently doing security app assessments at another consulting shop and want a better work/life balance, with less client interaction (management handles that), skip all the BS parts of reporting, no sales/marketing/PMs that don't know what they're doing and cause you grief, no multiple layers of management, no bureaucracy, no ""*I just broke the Internet and I'm better than you*"" egos/attitudes, and more time to hack on stuff during engagements or do whatever you want to do in your down time (yes paid research time is included for ALL members of our full-time consulting team.)

If any of this sounds interesting please hit us up with a resume||CV and links to any of your work that might be public or a description of any private research you feel like sharing.

**Pay/Benefits:** We pay in the ballpark of the larger consulting shops and we offer 100% coverage from top tier health/dental plans. We have lots of other perks for full-time employees like paid conferences, etc.

**Telecommuting:** We've been a remote first company since pre-virus days, we won't send you on-site for months....we care about your work-life balance.

**Contracting/Full-time:** Our preference is Full-time, if you're awesome and don't want to be an FTE email us anyways.

**Location:** We're looking for folks in -8 GMT through +1 GMT timezones (N. America, EU, or S. America only)

**Clearance:** Nope, we don't work in that field. Look elsewhere for WannaCyberInASCIF? work.

**Company Future:** 1) Do fun hacks with awesome clients 2) Have fun doing it 3) Can we do something awesome research/products/service wise? if not...4) Reinvest profits to GOTO #1.

**Contact email:** jobs (at) includesecurity \[dot\] com

And if you're not looking for a new gig right now, no worries. Give us a shout anyways we're always looking to meet-up with hackers at Blackhat/Defcon for a drink."

* A fully remote (working from home – anywhere in the world) role with only the need to travel to client sites when in-person meetings are required, or we are running a SwarmCon.
* A culture born of vulnerability research. Reporting missing http headers and SSL/TLS weaknesses is just ‘noise’. We focus on the actual sting (point of compromise) and continually look for new ways to breach our clients.
* Work when you want. We get the job done well but that doesn’t have to be 9-5.
* We all go to DEF CON, every year (well, when it’s not cancelled!).
* Unlimited Training – if it’s relevant and will help us you, your Hive and CovertSwarm to better sting our clients you can do whatever training you want to.
* Unlimited Holiday – We all need downtime, take it, whenever you need it. There are no prizes for burnout. You work to live, not live to work.
* If you speak at a major hacker/infosec event/con, we’ll pay your expenses and give you a bonus. We want to give back to this great community that continues to help us all.
* You will be at the bleeding edge of the industry.
* No politics - We're radically candid with one another, always.

We pay good salaries, have a brilliant culture and our Board are hackers too. However, if you are just chasing the biggest pay packet or are driven by your ego then we are not for you and you are not for us.

## What we're looking for

Our teams have varied skill sets and they work with each other to target and compromise our clients. We are looking for individuals with experience in one or more of the following areas who can work together to accomplish our goal:

* Web, Mobile, and Desktop application security testing
* Network and Infrastructure security testing
* Reverse engineering and exploit development

We don’t need applicants with an alphabet of certifications, we want to meet talented cybersecurity professionals and developers with practical experience and a deep passion for compromise. However, if you have any one or more of the following certifications, we want to hear from you:

Most Augmented PAKE algorithms either can't use a salt or must send the salt value to the user as part of the protocol, making them poor options. However, [OPAQUE](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-opaque-04) is being standardized as an option that both supports a salt value and keeps the salt private to the server. Cloudflare has [a blog post about how it can be used](https://blog.cloudflare.com/opaque-oblivious-passwords/) as well as [an online demo of it working](https://opaque.research.cloudflare.com/).

netsec,nr10cj,Why We Hash Passwords,Single_Core,h0h022z,t3_nr10cj,0,">his is a horrible practice because an attacker has access to every user’s account if they gain unauthorized access to the password store. This could be an attacker from outside of the organization or an employee such as a system administrator.

Not quite sure if I agree with this. I think if everyone used a password manager and unique passwords in each and every website they use, hashing could potentially become a thing of the past.

If they gain unauthorised access to the password store, they have access to all of the accounts regardless. Ill explain ...  


1) So either they can just dump all ur data, because they have access to an extremely sensitive part of the application so we can assume they have access to more.

2) They, for some reason only have access to the password store, they still have access to all of the accounts, because they can just generate a password themselves, hash it and replace it. 

3) They, for some reason only have access to the password store, which is only readable. Okay, fair point in this scenario you could potentially have a use from hashing. But then again, this is only secure if the user actually uses a proper password. If the password is ""qwerty123"" it doesn't matter if the best possible hashing algorithm and salting techniques are used. It'll get brute-forced in no-time.

This article is mostly just an introduction aimed at Python devs but the advice is sound. Argon2 is the current state of the art as far as I know and if your language/framework supports it you should probably use it. 

PBKDF2 isn't _bad_ as long as you use a decently long salt and a large enough iteration count to discourage brute-forcing (the recommendations are constantly increasing over time though as Murphy's law continues to hold so I recommend doing your own research here, same with the parameters for Argon2). You can also swap in different hash functions like SHA-3 in the case that the hash function you're currently using is broken.

It's a good idea to use a library that encodes the hash in either Modular Crypt Format or [PHC](https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-string-format/blob/master/phc-sf-spec.md), which stores the hash function used, salt, iteration count and any other parameters so your application can migrate to new password hashing schemes over time as standards evolve without needing to force all your users to reset their passwords at once. And it's much easier to store in the database because you can just throw it in a text column; it's not the most efficient but it's only one string per user, and you only have to parse it on login.

The other half of password security is just encouraging and enabling users to make good passwords. Length and uniqueness trump complexity; my biggest pet peeve is login systems that restrict the characters you can use in a password. The harder you make it to come up with and remember passwords, the more likely your users are to just reuse a password from another site, which is the last thing you want. 

Chrome and Firefox both are becoming actually pretty decent for password management; you can left or right-click on a password field and the browser suggest generating a random one for you and then offer to save the login on successful form submission. That's all I really use because I really can't be bothered to evaluate third-party password managers for myself.

From an end-user perspective I find that Firefox is a little bit stricter on where it detects login fields so to be sure it works try not to make your login form too convoluted, and actually test that both Chrome and Firefox offer to generate passwords and save logins."

You've got too much faith in banks. They're probably doing something like this:

netsec,nr10cj,Why We Hash Passwords,N3RO-,h0g70yg,t1_h0g5ah2,5,"The purpose of the salt is:

1. Make rainbow table attacks more difficult
2. Make identical inputs (in this case, the passwords) generate different hashes

You will find many sec books talking about password and this is the general idea. Any decent site implements salting for the passwords, it's simple and easy, there's no con, only pro.

This will make the attack way less successful. But it all go to trash if the person put an obvious password hint and it is stored alongside the hash."
netsec,nr10cj,Why We Hash Passwords,DrunkCostFallacy,h0gcbop,t1_h0g5ah2,5,"Yes, it is used to slow down an attacker. A hashing algorithm always has the same output when you enter the same data into it. For example:

>MD5 (""apple"") = 1f3870be274f6c49b3e31a0c6728957f

>MD5 (""apple"") = 1f3870be274f6c49b3e31a0c6728957f

>MD5 (""orange"") = fe01d67a002dfa0f3ac084298142eccd

What an attacker can do is take a dictionary of words (apple, orange, password, etc.) and hash it so they have a whole table of passwords and hashes. Then if they got a hashed password database through a hack, they'd be able to look up the hash of my password from the leak (1f3870be274f6c49b3e31a0c6728957f) and see that my password is apple.

By adding a salt to the end of the users password before hashing, the same password of apple with different salts have completely different hashes. Like so:

>MD5 (""applesalt1"") = 00d30ae7c87e80f5aa46f0162ccd9f60

>MD5 (""applesalt2"") = 5b48fd15928fb85f11cab5e0481a64c9

I basically got into an online argument on a certain forum (not Reddit) concerning the status of M1RACLES. My position was that it is not a real vulnerability (well, this is also stated by the author) because one can always modulate a shared hardware resource to implement clandestine data exchange. The opposing point of view was that M1RACLES violates the resource segregation invariants provided by the OS (or the hypervisor if we are to include virtualized environments as well), and as such, it should be considered a vulnerability.

It is mildly surprising how easy it was to build this PoC. You can see that there are hardly 500 lines of code in there.

Let's say for example you believe that an exploitable (via this method, which just means, most applications I guess?) application is running in a particular availability zone, and that there are several copies of it running possibly on the same host.

For example, let's say you assume that there are 10 ""production"" VMs and 10 ""test"" VMs.

Assume:

- you have no critical data in the ""test"" VMs, but because of this, you have access to read log files from a web server (as opposed to the""production"" VMs where you can't read the log files)

- on both production and test VMs, you have the ability to write to log files (eg. via executing HTTP requests)

- on both production and test VMs, you have the ability to modulate the CPU usage (eg. Execute some HTTP request, preferably one that uses consistent resources each time)

- given the above assumptions, can you determine which ""test"" and ""production"" VMs are on the same host? The critical point being, you want to identify which host has a production VM where you have access to a test VM on that same host.

I am guessing you could do this by issuing a bunch of requests to ""prod"" using a pattern like CDMA, and then at the same time issuing a steady stream of requests to ""test"", request the logs from test, then measure the time between the logged requests on ""test"" and attempt to look for the CDMA code. Given enough requests, enough time, and a long enough code, you could probably identify this?

Can anyone think of a stronger attack on the above than just figuring out which VMs are on the same host?"

M1RACLES reporter here. These are not opposing points of view; M1RACLES definitely qualifies as a vulnerability, while at the same time it is not a significant/impactful one because it is unlikely to provide an adversary with a significant advantage in most scenarios. A vulnerability can be real while simultaneously not something people should worry about.

Your demo is a good demonstration that covert channels already exist on all systems, but it does not moot M1RACLES. The difference in data rates here does make a significant difference. 0.06 bits per second, or even 1 bit per second, is not necessarily practical for many use cases, e.g. bulk transmission of keylog data between iOS apps (consider that iOS restrictions will likely limit the opportunities for a malicious keyboard app to run simultaneously with a malicious standard app, and sustained high CPU usage would likely be noticed by the user as a significant drop in battery life anyway). M1RACLES can easily achieve 1MB/s, which means you could pass through a month or more of keylog data in under one second of simultaneous execution. This is not a trivial difference.

For what it's worth, the bulk transfer M1RACLES PoC was the first thing I came up with that would let me get the video transfer clean enough for the demo; it's ugly and does no real retransmissions/FEC, it just sends every byte twice with some framing bits to try to detect drops. There's also a thing where the error rate is higher initially (I think it takes a while for the kernel to consistently decide to schedule the processes on the performance cores only, even though I request a QoS level that should bias for that; macos has no hard core affinity API) so I pad the TS video with 1MB of zeroes in front just to get past that. I'm sure if you built a smarter system with bidirectional comms for retransmit requests, smarter clocking, FEC, 3 or 4 states per xmit, etc, you could probably increase the data rate by an order of magnitude.

Edit: one more thing worth mentioning is that M1RACLES is an *architectural* vulnerability, not a *microarchitectural* one. While we can certainly assume the presence of certain *microarchitectural* side channels (e.g. execution units, etc), the existence of an overt data pipe you can use (which was clearly a design mistake) is certainly notable in its own right. Just because you can accomplish bad thing X with near-impossible-to-avoid subtle approaches doesn't mean we don't care about making X trivial and directly achievable using a design element (bug).

P.S. Mordechai Guri's work is the canonical example of a covert channel paper mill with nearly zero scientific value. His entire modus operandi is to pick any trivial, random covert channel (e.g. changing screen brightness), build the least-effort PoC you can possibly imagine, and crank out a paper. His ""using RAM sticks to send WiFi signals"" one had an outright deceptive title (no WiFi packets were ever sent, he was just measuring radio noise with a debug feature in a specific WiFi card), and was a rehash of an earlier one where he did the same exact thing, but for GSM. He doesn't try to figure out theoretical channel bandwidth capabilities, he doesn't optimize his encodings, he doesn't dig into the true nature of the side channels. I've read some of his papers and I think for some of the side channels he doesn't even know how they actually work. Given the crappy data rates he gates, he doesn't have much experience with modulation techniques, signals, or hardware in general. I'm sure if you use something like CDMA with FEC you could get much better error rates than his signals 101 level PoCs. His work is eminently replicatable by anyone with a passing knowledge of electronics/hardware, and could be improved by many orders of magnitude in bandwidth by someone competent."

These changes are implemented by launching and stopping a large group of threads each running a tight busy loop. The other VMs then observe minor fluctuations of the CPU cycles allocated to them per unit time, which are measured by incrementing counters in multiple concurrent threads. The amount of increments per unit time is measured continuously; this is a very noisy signal with a large DC offset, which is removed by high-pass filtering. The filtered noisy signal is then fed into the CDMA correlator which pulls the useful signal from beneath the noise floor (kind of like GPS does, along with some telecoms). Generally (excluding some exotic methods), you can't see the signal being transmitted unless you know the CDMA spread sequence, it would look to you like noise."

I must admit I am not a security researcher by any margin (I work with vehicular systems), so I could be missing some background or misusing the accepted terminology. The point of my little experiment was to demonstrate that M1RACLES does not add fundamentally new means of covert data exchange. Although I certainly agree with your point regarding the difference in the attainable bandwidth being critically important for most practical attacks.

I am just not entirely clear on the application of the term ""vulnerability"". If my PoC qualifies as one, doesn't it effectively render every system that relies on virtualized environments for isolation vulnerable by default? If yes, wouldn't it effectively deprive the concept of ""vulnerability"" of meaning, since basically every practical system would be vulnerable, and the usage of this term would communicate no information?

Re Guri's papers, perhaps we shouldn't expect too much practical focus from abstract academic research.

If my PoC qualifies as one, doesn't it effectively render every system that relies on virtualized environments for isolation vulnerable by default? If yes, wouldn't it effectively deprive the concept of ""vulnerability"" of meaning, since basically every practical system would be vulnerable, and the usage of this term would communicate no information?

Bingo. Stating whether a system is vulnerable in general, or not, without any context, indeed communicates no information. People outside the field indeed tend to misunderstand this :-)

Every system is vulnerable to *some* attack. There are two kinds of information that is useful to have:

1. Whether a system is vulnerable to specific attacks (including new ones). This doesn't, on its own, say anything about the security of the overall system. It is just information about component parts.
2. Whether a system can effectively resist attacks under certain attack scenarios, and what the complexity of those attacks is. This is what actually matters.

We already know all systems are vulnerable to certain side-channel attacks. In particular, all systems with shared resources have side channels. Those side channels are easy to turn into covert channels, as you did. The bandwidth, and the severity, is proportional to how closely coupled the security domains are (as you found out, where the VM boundary reduces your performance). As the severity gets higher, you go from 1 bit per second covert channels, to megabytes per second covert channels, to actually being able to steal data from noncooperative entities (actual dangerous side channels) under increasingly less demanding circumstances.

When Spectre and Meltdown came out, I said that some of these attacks are fundamental to how computers work, and that there is no way to protect ourselves other than to start changing how we write software and defining stricter, coarser security boundaries. For example, it was eminently obvious for *years* that SMT (hyperthreading) is a security nightmare if used to run two different threads from different security contexts, because there are obviously many very high bandwidth side channels thanks to the close coupling between threads sharing a single set of execution resources. It is only recently that we started seeing attacks developed for this, but the danger was there all along, and evident to anyone with some knowledge of how CPUs are designed.

Other problems, though (like Meltdown itself) are strictly fixable issues with CPU design. Intel have been particularly prolific about these, and seem to have a big internal culture issue. I particularly love L1TF, where, on failing address translation, their CPUs just decide to use the half-translated address anyway, in speculation - even ignoring VM (second stage) translation! Whoever thought that would be acceptable at Intel needs to learn a thing or two about defense in depth.

So M1RACLES is interesting because it is *not* a side channel - so it poses no danger of leaking data from unwitting processes - but it *is* a highly efficient covert channel, which does matter under a very small but not nonexistent set of attack scenarios. Does it *add* covert channel capability where none existed prior? No. But that doesn't mean it's not a vulnerability; as I said, we don't qualify systems on some kind of absolute ""vulnerable/not vulnerable"" scale. We look at individual issues and then figure out how they affect the overall security of the system under certain attack scenarios. In the example I gave of iOS keyboards, M1RACLES happens to provide a clear advantage to an attacker.

But even if the keyboard example didn't exist and zero attack scenarios were helped by M1RACLES - e.g. if other attacks were already strictly more powerful - it would still be interesting, and still be a vulnerability. It just wouldn't make the *system* more vulnerable.

Re Guri, the issue is that we've known for decades that computers produce EMI from which information can be extracted (even from a noncompromised system). Side channels are ""exploitable"" by definition under his attack scenarios, and we know those side channels exist (it is obvious to anyone that if a computer can blink an LED, you can send information with that, e.g. morse code). So he isn't advancing the field in any way. Everything he does is something we already know works. Even before reading his paper list, I jokingly came up with a dozen or so obvious side channels, then after reading it I found out he'd done most of them. His papers are cute weekend hacks, but they provide zero academic value. There *is* research to be done in this field (particularly estimating true channel capacities), but he isn't doing any of it.

People have been [turning computers into radio transmitters](http://www.erikyyy.de/tempest/) since  - well, that example is from 1997, but I'm pretty sure it's been done with minicomputers in the 70s and 80s too. He's decades too late with his ""not-really-WiFi from a RAM stick"" idea. Picking a different component and a different radio frequency doesn't deserve an academic paper. I could sweep an SDR receiver around my computer and find a half dozen interesting EMI frequencies, pick a random one at an interesting frequency, figure out how to modulate it, and receive it with something mundane that uses that frequency, and crank out one of his ""papers"" in a weekend. Or just spend 5 minutes [making your camera LED blink](https://twitter.com/marcan42/status/1339154825963978752) :-)"

As the other poster said, there's the desktop file spec (Linux's equivalent to .lnk files), but you can't bind them to a hotkey, making this exact type of attack vector not possible.

On the other hand, Linux (at least Gnome and a few other DEs) natively supports user-configurable custom hotkeys, which can be configured via the GUI or from the terminal using gsettings/dconf etc. So in effect you could use the same trick, ie to override a commonly used hotkey combination to execute malicious code."

Agreed. But there are other ways. One attack that I can think off the top of my head is embedding hidden code inside seemingly benign code snippet on a webpage to deliver a payload. 

""Power"" Linux users often tend to copy-paste code snippets from various websites, like say for say installing some theme in Ubuntu or getting some software or game to work correctly, or to fix some issue. 

Of course, power users might review the code first before blindly copy-pasting, but what many users aren't aware of is that [you can embed hidden code inside the benign copied code](http://thejh.net/misc/website-terminal-copy-paste), and if you paste this directly into a terminal then the hidden code can be executed without anyone even noticing anything. :)"

I'd love to look more into creating a custom drive partition and filesystem in Windows, one that uses a front-end for cryptographic details and such.

About the ""internal map"" I'm right about how it works?

I remember one of the bad points of Veracrypt would be that using the hidden volume will only changes blocks that are set as ""random data"". If someone could compare them it could bring up that there is a hidden volume.

For Rubberhose kinda understand that it could be any random blocks changing beceause there are no real part like ""layer 1 is from block 100 to 500"". It's correct?"
netsec,nmc6pu,Sekura - An Encryption tool heavily inspired by the Rubberhose file system,Cookie04_DE,gzqebk5,t1_gzps58d,4,The difference is mostly that you can have multiple hidden file systems instead of just one.

netsec,nmc6pu,Sekura - An Encryption tool heavily inspired by the Rubberhose file system,Cookie04_DE,gzqdzi9,t1_gzpb93v,5,"Correct. Sekura basically locates partitions by deriving a key from the password and trying to decrypt the header of each block. Then it got a list of blocks with valid headers and sorts them. They are randomly distributed across the disk. This is also the reason you must add all partitions before creating a new one, since you otherwise risk overwriting a block from another partition."
netsec,nmc6pu,Sekura - An Encryption tool heavily inspired by the Rubberhose file system,Cookie04_DE,gzqoj21,t1_gzqnw9j,5,Yeah I think so
netsec,nmc6pu,Sekura - An Encryption tool heavily inspired by the Rubberhose file system,jkadogo,gzqmxy8,t1_gzqdzi9,6,"Thanks for explaining.

I didn't know Veracrypt/Truecrypt had a limited amount of hidden volume. Anyway having the data distributed around the disk is a good thing.

Another question, how does it looks when you give the password from one of the layers?  Example if I do a partition of 50GB when I mount it, it's seen as a 50GB block or as \[data user of my 50GB\] / the whole hard drive?

Are there other advantage maybe over the other encryption systems? Like I said, it can lead to an ""heavily guess"" that if you use it you got multiple layers."
netsec,nmc6pu,Sekura - An Encryption tool heavily inspired by the Rubberhose file system,Cookie04_DE,gzqnod6,t1_gzqmxy8,7,It is exposed as a block device (e.g. /dev/nbd0) which size is approximately 50GB (slightly less because of the block header overhead). Then you can make a file system with `mkfs.ext4 /dev/nbd0` and `mount /dev/nbd0`. There are no other advantages over other encryption systems afaik. In fact: If you don't require this specific aspect for your encrypted disks/files I would recommend a more mature program (Sekura is still heavily in development).
netsec,nmc6pu,Sekura - An Encryption tool heavily inspired by the Rubberhose file system,jkadogo,gzqpo9w,t1_gzqnod6,8,"Thanks, is the block device not a bit against the deniability?

If you use 2 layers and you give the password for one of them it will display the size for the block device. If the block device not use the all hard drive it kinda feel like there is another layer.

My last test with Veracrypt, it was like if you mount the ""fake"" volume it still showed the rest of hard disk like free space and if you didn't protect the hidden volume you could just erase it without notice. I think the best will be to have something similar but I'm not sure it's possible."
netsec,nmc6pu,Sekura - An Encryption tool heavily inspired by the Rubberhose file system,Cookie04_DE,gzqq5ur,t1_gzqpo9w,9,"No not really since if you only need 2GB of space for something your not gonna allocate the whole disk for that so there naturally are unused blocks on a disk.

For your second point: Yes that is true, both for Veracrypt and Sekura since both programms assume the space is unused if you don't tell them otherwise (by mounting existing partitions)"

Having a user change ""B@dpa$$w0rd1"" to ""B@dpa$$w0rd2"" every 90 days doesn't keep someone who previously compromised the password out for long. Even assuming users wouldn't do that (and that's a bad assumption), if a password is compromised the average time that the account is compromised is half of the rotation window. Kicking an attacker out after 45 days of undetected illegitimate access isn't much of a security win (since rotation would only apply if the compromise was not detected through other controls). Older attack patterns may have relied on longer term persistent control over a single account, but most modern attacks establish better persistence quicker than rotation windows would stop. Rotation windows are generally on a different time scale than modern password cracking would allow, which is generally on the scale of years-millennia or minutes-hours. 

To get the benefits that rotation used to provide, we'd need to adjust rotation windows commensurate with the threat. Reducing windows to a week might make establishing persistence more difficult if combined with strong controls preventing password similarity and reuse. Of course, the drawbacks would make this untenable for nearly any environment."

I believe the guidance was that you should drop complexity and expirations, but *in place of those things* require things like MFA, monitoring for known-bad or known-compromised passwords, and monitoring/limiting of failed login attempts.

So if someone is reusing passwords and it gets compromised, hopefully that'll show up on your dark-web monitoring and they'll be forced to reset the password and not allowed to use it again.  If that doesn't happen and an attacker attempts a login, hopefully it'll get blocked by MFA.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that password managers are a bad thing.  Instead, I am saying that history has shown that we cannot rely on users using them as much as we want them to.  The NIST guide encourages password managers, but has lots of other good protections in place for the 85% of the world who does not use these tools.  And that's a good thing.  If we can fix a lot of security problems without telling users that they need to do extra stuff to protect themselves, that passes the psychological acceptability security principle.  In general, the ideal target state should be secure and easy for the user, not secure only if the user does this, that, and the other thing.  That's the ideal anyway.

The first framework I worked with 20 years ago wouldn't accept spaces.  I literally just realized I have been holding on to that for 20 years.

The second is I am trying to unteach bad habits like weird substitutions. My main problem with substitutions, capitalization and punctuation is they are highly predictable and don't add much to the password.

IMHO the primary problem is that when a user sits down to create a password the programmers goal is complexity and the users goal is simplicity. What we end up with is a collection of the simplest possible passwords that meet the complexity criteria. 

If you teach the user to make a long password that is easy to remember but hard to guess and show them it is a skill to be proud of you have done more to protect your system than any automated requirement.

I teach this in five steps

1. Passphrases - trade randomness for length

2. Personalization - names, places, feelings find specialized words with meaning

3. Obsolete pre-memorized data - old phone numbers,  addresses, information about people you don't know anymore, dead pets names etc

4. Make it meaningful - Don't just type your kids names, say what about them makes you proud, don't use your pets name, tell me their favorite trick.

5. Reuse secrets - we all have skeletons or things we don't want anyone to know, make it into a password. I usually also explain how I am completely incapable of looking up their password.


Just a side vent, I am currently in about the 20th fight of my career trying to explain exactly why it is a bad idea to email users their password. This stuff is easy to teach by comparison."

The rule you want to remember is to maximize memorability AND minimize guessability. 

Substitutions (a -> @, s -> $, l ->!, etc) are close to worthless. You have to memorize the placement and a program can test obvious substitutions more easily than they are remembered. The same goes for splitting symbols ( , ; \[\]&...) in between words. What becomes obvious is capitalization and special characters only help if their placement is truly random, and if it is truly random the difficulty in memorizing it will be greater than its actual value.

I even suggest minimizing the use of numbers, spelling out one, two, three, four is preferable to using 1,2,3,4.

The human mind is fantastic at remembering ideas and sucks at remembering data points. It is ridiculously easy to remember long statements and nearly impossible to guess them, the following is an extreme example:

mynameisrobertpaulsonandiwasbornonaugustsecondnineteenseventyseveninlansingmichigantojackandjillpaulsonthisisthepasswordforreddit

It has over 100 characters, 29 words, 7 proper nouns, and it is site specific so it won't be reused. This password is ridiculously easy for me to remember, hard for anyone else to remember, and effectively impossible to crack.

It can get even better:

mynameisrobertpaulsonandigrewupattwentyseventhirtyfourwesttwentyfirststreetmyfirstphonenumberwasfiveonesevenfivesixsevenfivethreeohninethisismypasswordforreddit

This is using what I call obsolete memorized information. Addresses and phone numbers of places you no longer live are already memorized, so why not use it. This password is even easier to remember than the first one. I could let the average person look at it for five minutes and they would have a hard time immediately recalling it. One would need to be superhuman to remember it after another five minutes.

I don't suggest using passwords over 30 characters unless you are really good at typing without error (I am not). The following is still kick ass:

igrewupat2734w21stst(reddit)

tl;dr if you want to make a password harder don't add a special character or a weird substitution. You can literally double the length of a password and it will be easier to remember than one weird random special character."

It's still a crap shoot timing wise, as a reused password on an external system could have been compromised before the user even sets that password on your systems.

To be clear, I'm not suggesting substitutions in the form of ca$h monie$, nor am I suggesting to capitalize the first letter alone. We all know that P@ssw0rd1! isn't a great idea, and I've also seen many users who simply take it to heart, capitalize the first word and put 1! at the end and think that ""PupperWoof1!"" is a good password.  

But if you're going to use a passphrase, IMO it makes sense to add symbols and capitalizations in where they would be natural. In the worst case scenario, they add to the character length. ""I don't want to go to the store."" gains two characters (an apostrophe and a period). In the best case scenario, the increase in keyspace could help in maybe some tiny way in the distant future.  

And for me, perhaps just as a result of typing with proper grammar and shit so often, it is _easier_ for me to insert these characters in. I will put the apostrophe into ""don't"" even if I am just chatting in all lowercase with my friends. Same for capitalizing an I or adding a comma.  

I'm sure that both permutations are equally fine in every _realistic_ scenario, I suppose I am just commenting that whenever I teach my friends how to create passwords I typically do not advocate for the complete _removal_ of caps or special characters.

Which kind of seems to contradict your earlier statment of having a local password store. I'm guessing I'm missing something here in translation/showing my lack of knowledge in this area; but it seems like what you are basically saying is you want all devices to have a local token manager that will store your tokes to every site you visit, and when you register to a site it should just add it's token to your store. 

So to be even more basic you want a password manager on every machine by default, but you want the websites to auto-gen the passwords and just add them direct to the manager?

Even the sites now that require registration of devices still require passwords and just use the device registration as a 2FA kind of deal; they don't just auto log you in to the same account based on the device you are on"

The JDEC spec tried to fix this by adding hardware counters to detect attacks. These are now completely bypassed with the new Goole attack and the TRRespass paper (https://download.vusec.net/papers/trrespass\_sp20.pdf). Work over the last year has discovered ways to launch the attack via Javascript (https://comsec.ethz.ch/wp-content/files/smash\_sec21.pdf).  
No attacks in the wild yet but it's rather disturbing. ECC still holds up and no one has been able to break through hardware based virtualization but the PTHammer paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08707) indicates that you should be able to use the IOMMU itself to attack it's own page tables.

\>I'm curious why ECC isn't more vulnerable. 

ECC is just as vulnerable but it provides you a hint as to what is going on. You need to flip at least three bits to bypass ECC. If you flip one the system could correct it but would have an inclination that something is up (especially if it started happening quite often). If you flip two the system can be configured to halt/restart (since it just encountered an unrecoverable error). Since rowhammer attacks are statistical in nature the attacker is likely to trigger a dual bit flip while searching for a useful three bit flip. If your system is just set up to reboot and continue as if nothing is happening then all this does is slow down an attacker but if you monitor your systems you would be able to tell that something odd is afoot (or that your hardware is failing)."

I believe some individuals would be better off learning the fundamentals to networking, learning how to work in a Linux environment, and then slowly progressing to a CTF environment.

Otherwise you may end up with someone who can ""do the thing"" but not understand ""the thing""."

hacking,a3oicn,How to start hacking? The ultimate two path guide to information security.,muniategui,eb8de8d,t3_a3oicn,0,I think that you missed the third way which may be linked to ctf path but they can be independent. Read read and read books and articles about how things work in network and computer world. If you are doing ctf you will need to read and learn how things work but you still can read without ctf.
hacking,a3oicn,How to start hacking? The ultimate two path guide to information security.,LeStankeboog,efu6ba6,t3_a3oicn,0,"There is a MASSIVE flaw in this suggestion. CTF's are amazing to put what you have learned to the test... but CTF's are not going to teach you core fundamentals. Every hacker should aspire to know not only the big picture but all the individual pieces that make up the puzzle.
No CTF is going to help you memorize the 4 layers of the TCP/IP stack and the 7 layers of the OSI model. Not that knowing those two things are essential but a basic understanding of Networking (at least) ABSOLUTELY is.
You could spend the next year playing with CTF's everyday and only learn a quarter of what you could learn in a single CISCO networking course. I just feel that there is no substitution for really sitting down and studying the craft. Listen to a Defcon talk while you take a free Python class on www.CodeAcademy.com, spend 30 minutes a day on a free class with www.Cybrary.com and another 30 minutes reading one of Kevin Mitnick's book to help immerse yourself into the world and mindset of a hacker. 
I can only speak for myself but I had to break some bad, lazy habits. CyberSecurity saved my life and made me a better person. I feel like a part of that was making myself sit down and crack open a book for at least an hour a day, it helped create discipline. I got a hold of ""The Basics of Hacking and Penetration Testing - by Pat Engebretson on Syngress Press."" By the time I finished it, I COULD NOT WAIT to restart it because I was getting apparent, noticable results.
CTF's are totally kickass, I endorse them fully (who the hell wouldn't?!) but if learning is your goal I feel there's faster ways to make gains. When it comes to practice though, there's nothing on earth better than a CTF.

Its like knowing how to shoot bullets and how the guns work but not possesing guns or not having gun will likely get you killed in combat. (Bad example but you get the point right?) IMHO the true approach should be dealing with both, if possible simultaneously. Infact I think that liveoverflow channel owner's most videos discuss tools along with methodology rather than seggregating them. To prove my point, On one of the bandit overthewire challenges, I ended up going the hard way digging up the file codes using hex editor to find the type of file which could have been easily done via file utility. So, to conclude: A mix method of both must be used, wherein people learn to use tools,kali and stuffs along with learning how they work on core level and should be approached in a rather gradual way."

hacking,a3oicn,How to start hacking? The ultimate two path guide to information security.,SlickLibro,eb92maj,t1_eb86py4,1,"A great question. Once you have gained enough knowledge to be able to find modern-day exploits, you may go out on the internet and look for active vulnerabilities. By finding one, and by disclosing it responsibly, you are essentially closing off an entryway to destruction. If the vulnerability is serious enough you may submit and gain a CVE (which stands for common vulnerabilities and exposures [https://cve.mitre.org/](https://cve.mitre.org/)) under your name, which is a rather grand achievement in itself. This is what one would call 'gray hat hacking'.

&#x200B;

However, this is not the only option. The knowledge you gain from just competing and learning about CTFs may be used in building solid network structures for companies, organisations, and governments. A more far-fetched idea would be thinking about the future of space exploration. Imagine being granted the job of engineering a space rocket's internet.

You may also create open-source security packages to patch systems and networks. You may also completely deviate away from security to use your knowledge in software engineering and entrepreneurship, to deploy your own business from the technical knowledge you've learned.

The number of possibilities is endless, as CTF is only a gateway into the realm of computing & programming. So essentially just dig deep and explore - your knowledge will take you on it's own journey."

hacking,a3oicn,How to start hacking? The ultimate two path guide to information security.,SlickLibro,ebeeg42,t1_ebdeeww,2,"I do understand what you are saying here, but I have to disagree with you on the point of not 'knowing the fundamentals'. CTF naturally forces you to learn the fundamentals in a very intense manner. There is no way you can progress through a CTF without understanding the 'big picture', and it most definitely does not teach you how to do very specific things in very specific situations.

&#x200B;

Take for example a simple case of any binary exploitation challenge - it requires you to disassemble the program in order to analyse the machine code - so that you can map out each and every individual function. You then use what you see to build a mental image of what you're dealing with, and then finally at that point do you consider your options for exploitation. In a matter of a few steps we've already covered learning the use unix commands, how a program is assembled in machine code, how to read the machine code itself, how the machine code interacts with the system's memory, and how to reverse-engineer such machine code into it's respective high-level language functions. Understand that CTF requires you to know the fundamentals/'big picture' as fluently as possible before you could even progress through the simplest of challenges.

&#x200B;

This example only covers one case, as CTF also expands out into forensics (stenography, data, & analysing network packets), web exploitation (which forces you to learn everything from js, html, php, common libraries, API's, to full stack web development), miscellaneous (which involves crucial scripting skills) and cryptography (for mathematics & encryption). In each and every single case you must understand fully what you are dealing with, or else you would be left lost with no direction.

&#x200B;

Through this knowledge alone one would eventually start seeing the intricacies of technology around us, and thus begin to see how they can apply their knowledge for use in real-world situations. The point of CTF may be directed towards exploitation, but there is any underlying set of fundamentals you must learn & apply if you want any chance of success - and this learned knowledge alone should be more than enough to use in real world scenarios."

hacking,a3oicn,How to start hacking? The ultimate two path guide to information security.,Nau71lus,eb9sqbx,t1_eb9pk9c,2,"I think there’s no wrong way into InfoSec, it just depends on the person.

Check out the humble bundle that was posted somewhere. There’s some really good stuff in there, but just googling basic ports, the seven layers, and networking fundamentals will get you on the right track. 

If you find yourself asking “what does that do” or researching more than you’re learning - then you’re heading in the right direction. 

Something I do in my InfoSec club is do a walkthrough of a CTF, and then give people a similar one to do themselves with aid when needed. Try something like that (: "

hacking,a3oicn,How to start hacking? The ultimate two path guide to information security.,loyalsif,ebgyib6,t1_ebeeg42,3,"I suppose it depends on how you look at it.

One one hand, CTFs do work as you've explained here, however because CTFs have a myriad of categories and challenges, you really end up putting yourself in specific situations for each challenge and then moving onto a completely separate situation and possibly forgetting the previous challenge.

Working your way up through the fundamentals and then focusing on one aspect of InfoSec (binex, netsec, websec, etc) for a long time until you truly understand it, then moving onto another category allows you to build your understanding without drinking from the firehose of security by taking multiple categories of challenges at one time.

Of course, CTFs/wargames are a great supplement for this type of learning. For example, if you are working on reverse engineering, [smashthestack.](https://smashthestack.io)org would be great to supplement readings of that type of subject to get practical experience.

Of course, this is just my opinion from my experience in the field. In obtaining the OSCP/OSCE and real-world pentesting, I've found that building the fundamentals separately helps much more when turning them into security related concepts."

hacking,a3oicn,How to start hacking? The ultimate two path guide to information security.,greengobblin911,egxib3j,t1_ebeeg42,3,"I myself was not a fan of the CTF approach and did the long term studying/theory approach.

I had a security class with who at the time seemed like the devil himself who liked  CTFs and made use do them for labwork; it's the ""throw em in the water drown or swim"" situation for learning hacking. It was a sentiment that teacher had and  boy did I drown a lot. 

I admire it for being the ""quick and dirty"" way to force you to learn a lot in a short amount of time, but I did not retain nearly as much as I would have if I had a better understanding of certain computer fundamentals related to OS features and Networking (TCP/IP). The CTFs forced me to know enough to pass the challenge, I wasn't learning how to think or how to do research as if I was really building an attack vector or trying to come up with an exploit akin to what security researchers or some pen testers might do while under contract with a scope of devices that may be limited or obscure. Most of what I learned in his class I had to revisit to retain it despite the harsh introduction to those concepts CTFs provide.

I respect OP's post whole-hardheartedly considering I have not seen a post assembled so well as he did it, but there's a certain ""discipline"" i think you find in having to comb through the boring stuff including the fundamentals that will make CTFs easier and more exciting when the person doing it understands what they're doing. As others said, CTFs vary so much; if someone does not diversify themselves in their CTFs they would fall into a niche or one type of hacking. Its not necessarily bad, but I feel like it limits your prospects.

&#x200B;

 Sometimes the boring theory over a period of time builds a bank of knowledge where you can know where to look for certain things despite the limited basic knowledge. Like that scary professor used to tell me:

""information security is a mile wide and an inch deep""

 you have to know a little bit of everything to *start,* not necessarily have the outcome ready and at hand. That does come with the practice of multiple CTFs, but my concern is someone who finds they are good at say, website pen-testing based CTFs, might only continue this because they find the gratification in solving the challenges,and being right all the time, especially for new and younger individuals, not everyone likes to hack because they like computers or are nerds like you say, movies and the media made people like us for better or worse, the ""hip and cool"" guys to be right now.  They would lack that ""shallow ocean"" of starting material to even consider trying their hand at something else like memory analysis or reverse engineering. I think that would start to bite you in the butt if they start to do this (hacking and penetration testing) professionally. 

&#x200B;

Take someone like Samy Kamkar for instance: Starts off as a Programming prodigy, makes his own company and inadvertently creates a XSS javascript worm and gives him notoriety.  Starts off with just web based stuff. Regardless if you like the guy or not, he's a critical thinker; since then he's had a variety of projects and attacks with a whole breath of varied technologies from NFC to PHP backends or RFID. His most recent stuff involved applied and time tested network attacks like MITM to smart/connected cars. 

What no one likes to acknowledge (or think about I should say) is the man like many other hackers and researchers comb over books and documentation and have to read and do ""boring"" research which might mean not being in front of a computer all the time. Hardware hacking is like a complete 360 from what he started off with, and certain exploits such as a MITM on a car comes from understanding of fundamentals and implementing it creatively. You wouldn't piece together different things like he would unless you understood the basics very well and was creative and experimented. The guy isn't a mastermind by any stretch, but he's one of those researchers that takes the wide limited knowledge approach and then forms a scope for further investigation and research. A CTF has an answer to it that is known to someone else, it may not be the best way to encourage creative thinking for the real application of hacking skills.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Capture the Flags could form a gratification loop in new inexperienced hackers as compared to forcing newbies to learn a little bit about everything including the fundamentals, as the gratification/feedback loop they enter keeps them focused on CTFs they are ""good"" at and limits their prospects in other areas of hacking they may have not considered because they don't do research on CTF topics they are not good at. This limits the ability to think of creative solutions (like those needed for real world exploit development/hacking).

hacking,a3oicn,How to start hacking? The ultimate two path guide to information security.,scriptalert1script,eejpy3y,t1_ebeeg42,3,"I see what you're trying to say here but I think that /u/Nau71lus raises a fair point.

You're not wrong when you say that it's impossible to progress through a CTF without understanding the 'big picture', but then you're creating individuals who focus on one area in an almost zombie-like way until they move through to the next challenge. When I'm partaking in a CTF and I get the gist or understand that a challenge has to do with steg, cryptography, or even just exploiting the function of a web app  - I work in those areas until I accomplish the task and then move on. Yes, I learn a lot in the progress but I'm looking for something to accomplish the task at hand rather than learning the fundamentals as to how embedding data in an image works, or when the exploit was found, how it was leveraged and then reading or watching a PoC. 

I suppose it really narrows down to who you are. He wasn't saying that this approach wouldn't work for everyone, but this approach might teach individuals bad habits, or the wrong things. You don't have to learn the fundamentals of an application to succeed in a CTF. I think you can look at those who've worked on Hack the Box machines and approach something like the OSCP which is less CTF-like and struggle since they don't understand some of the fundamentals. For example, it's far less likely you're going to face a steg challenge in the real world when attacking a machine or network. There are some fundamentals in CTF machines like using nmap or BurpSuite that are great for beginners to work with and understand, but using these tools on DVWA or Metasploitable would be far more beneficial for them as they could learn how to leverage, and then fix the vulnerability. 

I do believe that CTFs may give beginners a sense of direction, but I think that if they only focus on the CTF approach they will miss many of the fundamentals that are needed to excel in this area. There are some scenarios where CTFs are incredible learning opportunities, but I've played and owned many machines where I understood all of the fundamentals and was simply just mislead because CTFs are less real world like and more of a ""game"" or ""challenge"". HTB is a great example in the challenge section where no source code is provided and you're almost expected to guess the vulnerability rather than use the data (like in a real world scenario) to find out which attack vector to exploit."

For some individuals, like me, it can be kind of a poor substitute for learning. I definitely need to take some time to really learn the basics and get comfortable with linux and networking before I go back to attempting CTFs. For me, sitting down with books and tutorial videos is a good method, at least for where I am at right now. So I definitely agree with you in that regard. "
hacking,a3oicn,How to start hacking?

I’ve wondered about the fundamentals and what would be some good resources (e.g. books, video series, etc).  Would have suggestions on what the fundamentals are and any resources to study?

I was thinking at least networking would be one to study a lot of. I did a lot of self-learning on topics and always felt drawn to liveoverflow and Eli the computer guy, both on YouTube. If I came across a topic in a CTF/war game, I would make a note of it and study it later, trying to figure out how it worked.  

If you truly know how something works, you’ll be better at picking it apart and exploiting vulnerabilities I think. You can analyze it and come up with creative ways to bypass the security control. "

hacking,a3oicn,How to start hacking? The ultimate two path guide to information security.,greengobblin911,ej7mpky,t1_ej2qn9m,5,"The short answer would be to start reading and install a Linux distro. 

I personally do not recommend Kali linux, especially if you are installing it to hardware, BUT there's a great no starch press book called "" Linux basics for hackers. It forces you to get involved in automating your system, learning terminal commands and writing some of your own tools and scripts. My only gripe is the author uses Kali Linux. It's not typical of a Linux distro but it is THE pen testing distro. He installs it in virtual box. The book is very good for learning Linux in general as well. I would use that and skip most other books. Kali Linux revealed by the company who maintains Kali also is good. 

I would also recommend getting a tcp/ip reference book. Might be pricey but I prefer print copies. Anything with computers needs  reference material, especially when learning. It's impossible to memorize everything but as your hand gets better at hacking you will remember the most common things. 

Another book I would recommend is called ""attacking network protocols"" by James forshaw. If you read this, then compare what you're confused with against a tcp/ip reference book, you will understand a lot more about what is going on. 

This is why I was against using Kali, some people get tempted to use the tools right away but don't understand how it works. 

If I could start learning over and cut out the trial and error and confusion of information, I would do this. "

hacking,nrm4vt,The Taking of Transit 123- China is Suspected in Breach of MTA Data,greengobblin911,h0hbqg5,t1_h0h8zvb,1,"So what the article boils down to is the claim that recently installed (and subsequently removed) security cameras may have given foreign state actors the access they needed to move around the MTA's network, at least, the segment they were capturing data on before they were caught/able to pivot elsewhere. Pretty textbook vendor attack: the cameras have facial recognition capabilities and that software must be running on a backend controlled by this Chinese vendor; somewhere in that code, I would think there would be ways to ""easily"" make a socket to CCP or Chinese National Security interests to listen to whats going on on these devices. If it is API driven and the MTA did not make their own facial recognition instance and are relying on the identification done by the Chinese vendors on their hardware, the software would be phoning home to a Chinese IP range regardless. Once that connection is initiated, the attackers would be able to pivot where needed. Given that it was vendors that was compromised, but not personal information regarding consumers or payment information, as the article states, the MTA's segmentation of their network systems was effective, and controlled the potential damage to be done to control systems like track switches.   


An interesting detail that stands out to me is with the Incident Response; IBM is involved. For those who do not know, the MTA is in a ""migration"" phase away from metrocards and to digital payments via payment apps on smartphones this was going on before the pandemic but has since slowed down due to it; it never was completed. Many of the systems built for metrocard machines, turnstyles and Transit officer booths still work with the DOS-like OS/2 Warp 4 Operating system which was built by IBM in the 90s. It's a very common OS for lots of the systems in NYC actually. Allegedly, even post 9-11 NYPD central command still had some databases build around OS/2 until recently. New York choose to ""modernize"" at a time before Linux existed; so while Linux appears in many embedded systems across city infrastructure in other states or even in other major European Cities, most of the legacy tech in NYC is still IBM based. Despite the tip off from the FBI and NSA over the attack, the MTA still probably wanted to make sure that their public facing systems were not compromised somehow either, hence IBM's involvement."

Yes, that's possible. Safest thing to do is give the laptop away/destroy it and buy a new one. 

If it were me I'd never do anything sensitive on that machine in the future; losing control of the machine for *months* provides plenty of time for it to be shipped to some other location who would be capable of compromising it at a hardware level in ways you'd never spot with a visual inspection. 

Even if you just give it to a kid in your family to play games on, it may have a location tracker installed and be periodically transmitting its location and/or sounds that have been recorded when it was nearby.

hacking,np91qb,Modern trends and specific exploits as plot devices,james14street,h058tsv,t3_np91qb,0,"The use of deep fakes as a social engineering tool or spear phishing would be great. An example would be pretending to be someone important on a zoom call or getting someone to a specific location in a hurry with the exact voice of someone close to them. To make it realistic you have to mention the following process. 1st you have to get samples of their voice if you’re doing by phone or voice + appearance if you’re doing it on zoom/cam. You need hundreds of different samples. Secondly, he gives these samples to a program called a GAN or Generative Adversarial Neural Network. Thirdly, he’d have to use spoofing. 

When it comes cyber warfare on the level of nation states something that’s really being looked into is the combination of electromagnetic warfare with cyber warfare. Without the knowledge of electromagnetic warfare you wouldn’t be able to get malware onto something like a mobile missile launch system which is exactly what the U.S did to Iran when a drone was shot down in the Persian Gulf. 

You can also look at IoT hacking and methods for hacking air gapped systems. A nuclear enrichment site might have really good security but those new printers they just brought in might not. 

Passive RFID hacking, QR malware, and drones as a hacking tool would also be interesting. Also forensics on car infotainment systems is interesting. Take a look at Berla. 

You could also include fuzzing and the process of finding a zeroday. Intelligence agencies like to reverse engineer other people’s malware and use it to achieve simply tasks rather than creating their own. They only create their own tools for things no one else have done. 

Lastly, looking back at history hackers had the gift of gab. They were good a social engineering and manipulating people into doing what they wanted them to do.

hacking,np91qb,Modern trends and specific exploits as plot devices,94711c,h04es36,t3_np91qb,0,"That is really fascinating, and I wish you all the best of luck. When it comes to security and ""cool hacks"", I think they fall into two general categories:

\- Hacks where you ""get in"" by any means necessary - be it phishing, unpatched services exposed to the internet, password re-use from a leaked database, etc. This is where it doesn't matter if you hack into the admin assistant, the IT director or a janitor. It's generally low effort because somewhere, someone will have screwed up.

\- Targeted attacks: be it SCADA (a-la Stuxnet), VPN via an employee who VPNs from home (see LinkedIn hack), or by developing 0days - these require much more time to set up, but are definitely possible and within the realm of agencies or sufficiently big criminal enterprises that can afford buying the necessary tools and research. 

What I don't like about movies in general, is when the two mix without any resemblance of reality. Like ""oh let me write a 0day to target this guy's email"". And it's done without ever running a debugger twice. Like... no. The thing is, you don't need super-skillz to ""get in"" somewhere, but the narrow your target, the more time you need to spend researching and developing and the chances get smaller. 

An attack that would be spectacular to watch would be an effective CPU-based one (spectre/meltdown/rowhammer). Or something that actually exploits SSL/TLS/cryptographic attacks (even POODLE!), rather than live in the realm of ""it's insecure mathematically, but good luck exploiting it). 

Other fascinating attacks might be prototype pollution/type confusion, or anything that exploits the growing complexity of software layers. You don't need to bypass ASLR and create complex ROP chains when you can take control of software objects. 

But in the end, they're all bugs - there will always be another bug, another vulnerability to exploit. I guess it depends on what does the story actually need. 

DM me if you want to discuss in more detail, I find this fascinating"

My suggestion is to look a the incident response from high profile attacks. Congressional testimony in the US is good, but if you can find reports, then even better.

For example, here is the US Senate report on the Equifax hack: [https://www.carper.senate.gov/public/\_cache/files/5/0/508a6447-853f-4f41-85e8-1927641557f3/D5CFA4A0FC19997FF41FB3A5CE9EB6F7.equifax-report-3.6.19.pdf](https://www.carper.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/5/0/508a6447-853f-4f41-85e8-1927641557f3/D5CFA4A0FC19997FF41FB3A5CE9EB6F7.equifax-report-3.6.19.pdf)

There's tons of lessons in that report.

Another good one is the Nordsk Hydro ransomware as documented by Hydro: [https://www.hydro.com/Document/Index?name=General%20cyber-attack%20presentation%20April%2012.pdf&id=28255](https://www.hydro.com/Document/Index?name=General%20cyber-attack%20presentation%20April%2012.pdf&id=28255)

hacking,np91qb,Modern trends and specific exploits as plot devices,zaRM0s,h04vbxv,t3_np91qb,0,"I'd recommend researching the history of hacking and how it grew to become what it is today. How does security link into hacking, in a way they're like siblings. What is Red Team/ Blue Team hacking? What do the Purple team do? What are the different categories of hacking? What relation does it hold to programming? 

&#x200B;

Another thing I would recommend doing is spend a bit of time researching actual real life cases of hackers in interviews. A great place to start might be Kevin Mitnick. Try and get into the minds of these people and learn their interest, why they are so interested in making things do things they otherwise shouldn't, Edward Snowden is another example (although he wasn't exactly much of a hacker, the capabilities he did have I'm sure he could've broken into a system or two if he wanted to) but he would've had somewhat similar interest to those of a hacker, just perhaps a little more on the 'good' side. Learn the different use-cases where hacking might be useful? What different tools might be used and what category of hacking do they fall into? What are the most commonly used tools? What is Linux? What is a Kali Linux Distribution? What is open-source? I think this would be a good starting point and learning how to follow on from these questions and ask yourself your own. Really learning the area would be beneficial but I also think learning the terminology and using it correctly is extremely important for its success. For example, don't be the 'Take down the mainframe' type guy. Basically, make it believable to a somewhat novice hacker and I think you're on to a winner. 

&#x200B;

Sorry I couldn't provide any information on tools myself or anything but I felt I had something to offer to help out. I do know some hacking principles myself but I wouldn't want to embarrass myself as I am very much a noob at it.

How it works here is sort of like signing up to a WiFi in a shop, except you need to already have an account with that ISP.

So, for example: I am with Virgin Media - I am walking through a different city, in a suburban area, so no City WiFi. I can connect to any random houses Virgin Media - because they would have their own private SSID, and a public SSID that after I connect to it, will need to input my account details. This line, is totally seperate from your actual line, so if you were paying for 250MB, you would actually have a 500MB line in, which gets split, so its nothing off of your own bandwidth, and is just a feature for customers to have access to free wifi whereever you go, and their service is provided. 

The only crossover with your network, is that your router physically controls the network, but other than that its on a totally seperate V-Net etc.

Not only can one mask their IP, they can also spoof their MAC address (typically unique to a physical device).

Think about how each of your device in your home has a private IP address. They all route their traffic through your router and make it to the public IPs as unique IPs. This is possible due Network Address Translation (NAT). The same effect goes into play when public IPs try communicating with devices in your private network. Your router knows where to place that traffic. 

In the case of a router being essentially shared between your network and a neighbor, any device that is capable of packet sniffing (software like Wireshark) on one of those networks or that has access to the router could easily help determine the device that is viewing child porn.

Your Internet connection isn't like a water pipe. There isn't a fixed bandwidth of how much can be used (aside from technical limitations such as fibre or cable. If cable then which DOCSIS standard is used, etc). Even your plan that you pay for is very much an artificial limitation. The ISP isn't working harder if you have a 100Mbps connection vs a 40Mbps connection. All that changes is the ""speed"" you're allowed to use at any one time.

However you would most certainly be opening up yourself to an investigation by the FBI, local police or whoever happened to decided to go after the kiddie porn user because they would have no clue who was downloading it beyond the IP address which would point to your connection.  So you could almost certainly expect them to knock on your door with a search warrant where they would tear your house apart, confiscate all your computers and related devices for a complete examination.   Now assuming you had no kiddie porn on your stuff you would unlikely get prosecuted but you would remain as a suspect in the eyes of those cops with them always wondering if you were just lucky enough to have destroyed all the evidence before they arrived.  And of course because they thought you were  pervert when they went through all your computers and crap they would almost certainly make note of any other evidence for any other crime they might be able to nail you for simply because they would be trying to get you for something.  So if you had ever download a movie, software or music illegally they would almost certainly nail you for that if they could find nothing else.  

So you can decide if you are safe if your neighbor does some shit on your network.  I would never want to share my network for a neighbor.  It isn't as if you are going to have a system that tracks where traffic goes on your side.  A lot of wifi routers use dynamic addresses so its possible that the neighbor watching kiddie porn could be using the final address that you sometimes use to watch netflix.  Would you be able to prove which device was pulling porn?

I am getting my master's degree and I would never be able to finish my project without the papers I downloaded for free from Sci-hub. And my uni buys subscriptions to some journals at least. But not all.

The scientific publishing industry runs itself like a cartel. Nobody is paid from the money these publishers make. The bulk of the work (like peer review) is done by volunteers. They take far far more than they deserve. They also charge researchers to publish their work. You have to pay to get published and you have to pay to read the published work."

The biggest problem I think you'll run into is the power. You'll have to power the Pi with enough energy to run the cellular hat, and the 2 RTLSDR's draw a fair amount of power in a small setup like this if they're constantly listening. If you can find an external power source wherever you may be that you can use, that would be ideal.

Being confined in a waterproof case, heat may also become an issue as most of those cheaper RTLSDR's generate a lot of heat by themselves, let alone also running a Pi.

I don't know what the best solution for this would be, but maybe vent the case for the heat to escape? You're not going to get much air flow, but it would help if the heat had somewhere to go."
hacking,nnuamp,Pi Black Box,deathreaper1129,gzzk2d4,t1_gzzaxvu,1,Thanks a ton i was considering heat as a potential issue. I was thinking about using a collapsable row of solar pannels to power it either that or a decently sized rechargable battery pack or 2. Gonna have to mess with the power settings on the pi to get it to work either that or run 2 pis. I figured heat might also be an issue i got a box with holes in it for both ventalation and routing wires out of the case figured i could use an ice tower and some passive cooling pads to prevent malfunctions due to overheating.

I've never really been able to understand this though and I'm genuinely curious, Is there anyone (Professionals) that would ever be able to actually make use of all of this in any meaningful way? I get that some things could be useful in some cases, but it also seems like a lot of these would just be irrelevant?   


A lot of these either seem pointless/just for fun/an evolution of the spy kids toy's you used to get in the 90's (I'm sure they're older than that, that's just when I remember them from) or like it'd be easier to accomplish with malware or a basic af script anyway? Reality is, most of these require physical access to the premises, or in some cases, straight up physical access to a machine or some REAL smooth sweet talking and a victim that doesn't understand what's happening at all.   


I'm genuinely curious, if anyone has a logical purpose for this (Beyond a VERY specific use case/demo etc.) please enlighten me? I think they'd be fun to play with as toys. But I'd MUCH rather build something more discreet, myself, for less money.

the idea of being thrifty, not being wasteful, and doing it yourself is excellent and i think you should just stick with it. just remember to use ventilation when you're soldering to avoid fume inhalation. be careful what you touch when salvaging things, electrical discharge is not the only potential danger; some gases and other substances are odorless, colorless, and/or flavorless, but are still really bad for you.

Plus most times you probably won’t be able to do that.

So in light of that, you are going to need to target cryptographic keys in the TLS session.
These are present already, and would give you a way to decrypt on the fly using wire shark. There is a detailed explanation of it in the link below, and I’m sure some more digging and searching through google will probably give you more to work off of.

Let me break it down from someone who made a transition from one career path to another.

I was a professional mechanic. I worked on things most people couldn't fathom the operations of, little own the repair of.

Should I have spent countless hours machining and fabricating tools that could be bought off a shelf? Absolutely not. Did that make me any less of a technician? Not at all. To be fair, I spent plenty of years working on heavy equipment. Which in certain aspects, did mean I was forced into fabricating tools that I nor my shop had on hand, and we couldn't afford the downtime waiting for a specialty tool.

This works exactly the same way as a professional in the InfoSec world, regardless what side they are on. Existing tools reduce time and increase your flexibility. The skill comes with knowing how they work, how to apply them, and how to make them flexible to your needs."

There would be no radio transmissions from the fences inwards, basically cell blocking. Every section would have a closed network physically. Policies in place so that only one device can pull data onto a specifically encrypted device using another means of transfer other than usb. Probably a custom protocol or transfer type.

Only one other device in the world to decrypt the data.

I am also a full stack developer (since long before I ever heard that term). One company still uses code, today, in production, that I wrote as a teenager - which doesn't say as much about my programming skills as it does about how stubborn companies are in general.

When I was younger I used to ""program ahead"" several weeks or months even. I would spend my ""free time"" fucking off, touching up documentation and fabricating ""update patches"" that were just me uncommenting code or renaming files. :/

I did this after working my self out of a couple jobs. Especially as a contractor - if a company is willing to pay me for 3 months to develop something that takes me 3 days, but I give it to them on the 4th day and they stop paying me, I have only screwed my own self over..

hacking,nlsrc8,What is your biggest regret of all time in learning hacking? And what advice would you like to give who's newbie?,occamsrzor,gznomex,t3_nlsrc8,0,"One doesn’t “study” hacking. A hack is understanding a technology well enough to realize (both figuratively and literally) a behavior in the technology that was otherwise unintended.

For example; let’s take something simple like a DHCP lease starvation attack: DHCP servers respond to requests from MAC addresses for IP leases. One MAC gets one IP (per scope). If the same MAC re-requests, it gets offered the same IP until the lease length is reached (I’m ignore the 1/2, 3/4, 1 rule for demo purposes). The inventors of DHCP never considered someone would attempt to lease ALL IPs in the pool (preventing other legit clients from getting one). Primarily because at the time, MAC couldn’t be virtual (they’re burned into the firmware on the NIC at production, but with the rise of VMs, VMACs (to coin an acronym) are a thing, which unintentionally created a mechanism by which DHCP could be broken).

Understanding DHCP well enough to troubleshoot something like DHCP lease exhaustion is the professional part of that problem, and provides a rather easy segue into the hack itself.

You don’t study hacking. You study the technology exploited during a hack."

I could say that I regret not continuing to sharpen my programming and networking skills, or not abandoning IT as a career plan early in high school, etc. But what I really regret, is not taking more risks and letting fear stifle me into inaction.

hacking,nlsrc8,What is your biggest regret of all time in learning hacking? And what advice would you like to give who's newbie?,helmutye,gzl4196,t1_gzkp3yo,2,"Time spent learning something is only wasted if you fail to find a way to utilize that knowledge. And little if any knowledge is truly useless.

One of the coolest things about hacking is that it's about results, not process--sure, there are some steps that tend to result in more favorable outcomes under current conditions, but as conditions change so too do the steps that lead to more favorable outcomes, and if you invest too much in learning today's steps you may wake up tomorrow and find that you can no longer achieve favorable outcomes and have no idea why or how to change your steps.

In my experience, hacking favors broad knowledge and experience and a distinctive way of approaching situations, and the more things you have learned the better you will be at learning new things as needed (and one of the most important skills for a hacker is learning how to learn). 

For my part, my formal education was in behavioral science and I spent my free time playing Dungeons and Dragons, and I didn't even start learning computers until after college. This made some things a little more difficult initially...but I found ways to apply the things I learned about exploiting human behavior and game systems to exploiting technology and the way people use it, and this has given me an edge that is both valuable and difficult to defend against because it is different from how many other hackers approach things.

The path you take may close certain doors--there are definitely aspects of hacking that I may never master because I still haven't mastered certain things, for instance. But there is a *lot* of work to do and a lot of ways to do it.

And I think people will benefit more from finding ways to bring new knowledge to the table rather than trying to learn what everybody else already knows and hoping they learn it *better*."

I studied for my security+ exam and took that last summer. I started a python project on a basic port scanner and another on a vulnerability scanner. Added those to my GitHub and used all of those things in my portfolio to get my current internship as a SOC analyst. Eventually I'll study for my OSCP along with tons of other documented projects and experience to hopefully get a red teamer/pentester position.

Here's what to take from that. 1 single thing will not get you a job in cybersec. You need a few things. Projects, certs, experience. The degree certainly helps and is slowly being required more and more. But some job postings don't even specify what degree they want you to have. They'll just say ""computer science, information systems, or any other relevant degree"" or they may just say ""degree"". 

If you do projects in your downtime, it shows your interest and that's the biggest thing (I think) that sticks out to potential employers."
hacking,nlsrc8,What is your biggest regret of all time in learning hacking? And what advice would you like to give who's newbie?,redrosesburningblack,gzmxolw,t1_gzm4nmv,6,"Even if it were actually bulletproof, we can extend this:

A bulletproof vest may protect your torso (see fine print, terms and conditions may apply).

But that doesn't help much if you take concussive damage and your lungs are crushed. Or if you get shot in the femoral artery, inhale gas, get exposed to radiation, or if you ignore an infected wound, etc.

Okay, pedantic maybe, but you can't control for or foresee everything. Donald Rumsfeld was a Dubya official when I was younger, and at one point he said this, ""Reports that say that something hasn't happened are always interesting to me, because as we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns—the ones we don't know we don't know.""

Slavoj Zizek (apologies for spelling), who is hardly my favorite philosopher (even to hate) criticized Rumsfeld regarding the Iraq war, but the meat of what Zizek said offers another good point, ""...the 'unknown knowns' - the disavowed beliefs, suppositions and obscene practices we pretend not to know about, even though they form the background of our public values.""

And hackers fall victim to social engineering just like anyone else. To accidents. To bad luck, tiredness, poor health, etc. To hardware security vulnerabilities they didn't know about until it was too late (because it was already used against them).

I suppose all that may sound paranoid, which is itself can be a danger, having you jump at shadows and get distracted by your own anxiety. Ultimately, mobility and resilience tends to require compromise. And in any endeavor or stage of life, you need to understand it's probably not going to be your whole life for the rest of your life."

Thank you, I hope it's helpful. it's something I've given a bit of thought to. My high school counselor literally made me read a book about Kevin Mitnick's capture.

It probably didn't teach me whatever lesson he wanted it to, but just looking at how things go wrong so often is basically the life of anyone my age who was paying attention to certain things. My friends all wanted to make videogames, which is just not as amusing to me. Why code a game, when your code can make the network or terminal a game?

And getting caught doing some minor nanny software subversion for a school project in middle school, made me realize that I wasn't as aware of things as I might think and I need to just pay more attention and do less in some cases.

The value of intelligence in the sense of information, not just on the immediate situation, but potentially intersecting ones, really can't be understated. Not knowing something can make all the difference.

When I was older, I was an environmentalist and I wanted to join some radical group. In the process, I found out about how the feds (not just the FBI, but usually them) find a member of such a group (and also groups that couldn't reasonably be deemed a threat, but activist groups were infiltrated regardless of that) and use them.

In many cases, feds potentially instigate trouble, like trying to sell illegal goods after encouraging some kind of escalation. Or teaching potentially dangerous things apparently in the hope someone will act on it, so they can bust them. Often the people the isolate and turn fit a certain demographic, because those people are more individualistic."

hacking,nlsrc8,What is your biggest regret of all time in learning hacking? And what advice would you like to give who's newbie?,DrinkMoreCodeMore,gznh08e,t1_gznfs6o,8,"Spent probably ~28k on lawyer fees, lost all electronics for 4-5 years (in fbl custody bc seized), seized all my bank accounts and funds, and worse of all is that I lost all my online friends and acquaintances at the time (they were into same thing so it was understandable). After 2 years of legal issues, I ended up getting off on a technicality/FBl chain of custody procedural mishap and I also had an amazing lawyer. 

Some takeaways: 

It's really easy to break the laws and commit cyber crime when you do not have to obey or follow any laws or rules.

It's certainly a lot better to be on the right side of the law.

When it's the US Department of Justice VS you, you are nearly always going to lose. They have unlimited time/funds/resources VS you who just has a single lawyer and very limited funds and resources.

Get a good lawyer. Listen to their advice. Do not talk to law enforcement of any kind without a lawyer.

When you get raided, do not talk to the special agents at all.

You are going to get depressed post-raid. It's normal. You'll be okay. Just live a day at a time.

Being raided is scary.

Use your powers for good VS evil.

Being white hat is a lot better long term VS being black hat.

Beware of informants. There are a ton out there. Never reveal too much about yourself to an unknown or new person messaging you. Keep in the back of your mind ""if this person finds out who I am, and they get busted, can they rat on me"". If so, you are already too late and fucked. Try to not mention anything about personal stuff. Keep it business only strictly.

Do not use Skype, Discord, FB Messenger to talk to your crime partners. Anything that keeps logs or can be subpoenaed. Do not use. Stick to stuff like Telegram, Signal, Jabber OTC.

Wipe your servers frequently. Obviously never log into the servers you are doing dirt from directly. Always use a proxy or VPN.

Always keep backup $ separately from your regular bank accounts. Where it can be accessed if your main accounts are frozen. Precious metal like Gold or silver is always a good safe bet. Easily can be converted into USD again.

Keep a spare laptop in the trunk of your vehicle and a go bag type setup. Have like 5k cash, a laptop, burner phone, etc. You'll need a place to stay, a computer, and money if you get raided. Even just cash and a laptop would be fine or just cash. I had to get someone to western union me $ to buy a laptop and pay for a hotel for me to stay in."

My only argument in response would be history dictates it to be entirely possible due to the technological advances we have made in the past 20 years, let alone the past 100. But the sheer pace in which we are moving currently is nothing we have experienced before. Therefore it is entirely possible, and still entirely impossible at the same time that we will ever have them in our homes, but it is still possible. Therefore, you cannot rule it out. 

Currently speaking, yes. Also, given the technology needed to hold such a device at a optimum temp, securely so the user can move around freely and not break it, it would be a stupidly expensive product on the market. 

In response to that I would argue that their currently isn't any need for us to have said technology as its not really applicable in the real-world currently. Therefore, why waste time researching whether or not they would actually end up in our homes practically at all? 

However, I do think the evidence points towards us not seeing quantum computing anywhere near us (unless you come across one in a professional manor) for the next 20 years or so. And even still, it will be a fair few pennies."

Realistically we don’t actually want quantum computers to replace our current ones.  
Just like GPUs are optimised for Geometric math problems , CPUs do more generalised maths. To this extent , quantum PCs will only be better at specific kinds of maths compared to current CPUs , thus the better solution may just be to have data centres that we offload workloads to (considering wireless connectivity will no doubt be so much better at this point of time). 

Honestly despite how much we have advanced there are several problems we haven’t solved, it’s taken over 100 years to create Fusion reactors for example, yet many scientists still believe we are a long way away from creating a reactor that is actually useful, if ever. 

Quantum computing is arguably more complex and many scientists even doubt the practicality of such systems or if they will ever actually be successfully created in a manor that is practical. 
  
Now to try an mobilise this technology , wow , I mean we are going to have to make a lot of pretty incredible discoveries over the next few decades to make that possible.

> This allows attackers to push the trends they want to the top of Twitter Trends despite deleting their tweets which contain the candidate trend shortly afterwards.

> &quot;We found that 47% of local trends in Turkey and 20% of global trends are fake, created from scratch by bots.

And a ""Quota"" to fire people? WHAT???? Seriously, that's dumb. I've NEVER heard of a quota to fire... Again, No evidence to show this is what is happening. The money it takes to hire, train, and deploy people is huge. Of course they track their attrition metrics, and to try to meet their attrition metric probably means NOT to turn over more than x people per year.

I'm not saying it isn't happening, and for the record, I DONT like amazon, and refuse to pay a monthly fee for inflated prices...I'm just saying... I'd like to see evidence, and this article provided NONE...."

I don't know if it's specifically a quota to fire people, but Amazon has a bottom X% performance plan mandate based on stack rank. It's part of the annual review cycle. Anyone below the threshold gets put on a plan which can lead to termination. I think this only applies to white collar staff btw. If you're packing boxes in a warehouse, you just need to show up and do your job.

I think the percentage cutoff is around 10%. I know several folks who used to work in various PM and engineering roles at AMZN who can attest to this."

pentest,nqmud5,Thanks.,mrdeadbeat,h0cc7vt,t3_nqmud5,0,What exactly are you seeking help with?
pentest,nlfk3l,Checklist: What Should Be Considered When Ordering a Pentest,520throwaway,gzifj5r,t3_nlfk3l,0,"> Do your experts have verified CVEs?

> Do your experts have any commendations for discovered vulnerabilities?

> Have your experts delivered their talks at specialized conferences (Black Hat, Defcon, RSA Conference)?

These questions are all shit because they questions ask for a security researcher, not a pentester. Not every good pentester is also a security researcher and that in no way puts into question their understanding of existing security flaws into question. Some security researchers can also be shit pentesters.

> Do your specialists have certificates confirming their proficiency?

This is good to ask and I'd be very surprised if any pentest firm didn't have a standard answer for this (in a bad way)

> Is it possible to make a project plan in advance to understand how the work will go and what the final cost of the service will be made up of?

This is often known as the Scope, and is an essential document for any testing. If the firm does not provide this prior to testing, DROP THEM!

> What pen testing methodology will be used?

All firms should have a standard methodology, even if it is only slightly more detailed than what you can find in the likes of OWASP. If they do not have this, drop them immediately.

> What data should be provided?

Definitely ask this! mainly useful after coming to a conclusion  from what perspective the pentester will be attacking from (that being, complete stranger, receptionist, or someone with access to source code and the like)

> Can you change the course of penetration testing in the process?

You will only ever hear 'yes'. Any 'pentester' that is incapable of this has no right to call themselves a pentester, and your average firm knows this well.

> Is it possible to pentest at night hours and on weekends, so as not to interfere with the services?

Only ask this if you intend to have someone on your side working those hours as well as an emergency contact. You DO NOT want a pentester accidentally taking down services with no emergency contact on-hand for an entire weekend or afternoon. If you don't wanna do that, it's actually safer to do tests during the working day.

> How will the communication between the customer and the pentest provider be held?

Yes! and answer you want to hear will involve stuff like encrypted channels (do not confuse this with encrypted files, though that's something you'll want too) and one-time distribution links.

> What will the report contain?

Not a bad question. The right answer to this is just about everything.

> In what format is the report provided?

Also not a bad question. The correct answer is you DO NOT want it in an editable format such as DOCX. You're supposed to be able to rely on the information inside as coming straight from the testing firm.

> Will it be possible to make edits to the finished report? If so, for how long?

Amendments. You want to make amendments to the reports. You do not want to be making wholesale edits to report contents, but typo fixes and appended updates are agreeable here.

> Will the report describe the steps and scripts to reproduce the vulnerabilities?

Good question and the answer should be 'yes'

> Will the report describe unsuccessful attack vector implementations?

I wouldn't fault a testing company for not dedicating more than a sentence or two to unsuccessful methods, and ideally that would be to give a general overview of the security landscape of the tested system.

> Is there an option to change the template of a future report?

Bear in mind, in 99% of cases, changing the template will only serve to make the test more expensive for no practical gain. The testing firm's default template SHOULD already cover everything you'll realistically need to see in a report (and if it doesn't you should drop them). And someone will need to spend time, potentially hours, drafting up a new template, which will only cost you money.

> Will intermediate results be provided? (This is relevant for long pentests.)

Change 'will' to 'is it possible to have'. Most testing firms will say yes to this, but you do need to ask for it.

> Will it be possible to get information about critical vulnerabilities before pentesting is completed?

The correct answer to this should always be 'yes'

I'll go through the others later"

I don't see anything wrong with asking these questions. I'm a pentester, not a researcher, and I have multiple CVE's and know other pentesters with CVE's as well.

But it's a security research question, not a pentesting one. Just because they *can* mix doesn't mean that it is always the case, or even the norm. At an organisational level, unless they happen to know of some shit their testers did in their own time, they can't answer that unless they have their own research wing.

CompTIA Network+ and CompTIA Security+

And then focus on learning the following:
Python, Bash, Linux (terminal), Windows (command line), Active Directory. For Linux, work around Debian and stay away from security flavours such as Kali and ParrotOS until much later.

I'd look into brushing up your offensive skills first.  https://tryhackme.com is a pretty good starting point with their learning paths.  After that I'd consider PenTest+ and then OSCP, or just straight into OSCP.  People used to recommend going with the eLearnSecurity certs, now INE, but I can't recommend them anymore for the price that they're charging.  While the eJPT (their into cert) is reasonably priced, I would argue you could get the same level of learning via tryhackme at a fraction of the cost.  Granted you don't get a shiny cert at the end, but I'm honestly not sure what value the eJPT gives you anyway.

OSCP is the main one most ""true"" orgs are looking for.  CISSP is the ""mile wide and inch deep"" certification and isn't necessary for a red team role.

pentest,jeo6eq,XSS usage,mpink-man,g9iz61r,t3_jeo6eq,0,"If you're actually scanning your own site - more than likely false positive. Did you code your site?
Look at why XSS happens in the first place and think of what's happening, also depends on type of XSS and in what context. Blind? Reflected? Dom-based? Most automated scanners look for dom-based occurrences based on (often faulty and misleading variable sets) 

How fluent are you in JS? Basically unless you know javascript forwards and backwards you probably shouldn't look that far into XSS. Most of the bounties I've been awarded for XSS, and I'd say 55% of successful exploits on red team engagements or pentest have come from my manual implementations. Also I have scripts I've written that are for certain use cases bc I personally find most XSS ""tools"" are just noisy false positive terminal windows.

Also, unless you've got crypto exchange, very shitty configured indexes and robots.txt that have lead to config files, known footholds, or popular RCE instances being indexed on Google you don't have to worry about anyone exploiting a XSS on your site. Also depends on where its hosted, what stack, if DB, how db queries handled, etc.

And just bc I gotta say it, if you're not doing this on your site I'd just stop now. If you're not pretty proficient in JS coding the likelihood you'll leverage and XSS in the wild is pretty damn rare. Also using automated scanners on sites in the wild as an unexperienced noob is asking for

1. Luckily stumble upon something an off the shelf tool alerts about, but you don't have the knowledge or skills to leverage exploit if its not spelled out or done automatically. Now someone likely knows about it bc of how loud and clumsy these automated tools are and you'll get blacklisted, sent to authorities, vulnerability is patched.

2. You get very very lucky and get something to carry out somehow. However being so green you're unable to properly obfuscate you're execution or jus overall opsec in general. So if it is real execution, you're logged and likely very accurately. Also chance a decent IR team or devs abused by redteams have forwarded you into nowhere, a canary, honeypot, etc and you're exploit means nothing.
If you want to learn theres tons and tons and tons of places to do it. Just sayin. Feel I gotta be realistic and convey your odds if that is indeed the situation so you got some realistic expectations.
Otherwise, yea."

pentest,jcjzpf,I want to learn.,mbareck7,g96bw90,t3_jcjzpf,0,"# Intro

Hello there, I'll answer based on my own experience, l'll tell you what i had already as knowledge in IT field before  my pentest (Web pentest) journey, what i did (i mean broke :) ) in six months, and most importantly what i have learned (techniques, books, sites, guide and tools).

# My knowledge before web pentest.

At the time i was a networks and systems security student, so already i had a decent knowledge about Web technologies and programming even I developed many Web applications.

I was family with \*nix like systems and bash scripting.

Network was my strongest area at the time. I was familiar with all necessary network protocols (IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP, HTTP...) and technologies/infrastructures (Firewall, Router, Switch, IPS, VPN....).

And finally a bunch of theoretical knowledge related to security concepts and stuff (Integrity, confidentiality,.... cryptography, numeric signature.....).

**With all of that mentioned above, i wasn't able to exploit anything !**

Be cause, i never got hand dirty and try to exploit something, *so first lesson you need to practice and try to do something*.

# The beginning of pentest journey

My graduation project consist of doing Web pentest, on online web platform let name it XYZ.

So I started taking some real and effective actions after many research on internet and reading many subjects, i believe these following are the best things to start with.

First of all watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1nNPiH_Go) then continue, it's Bug Bounty Hunter Methodology v3 by [Jason Haddix](https://twitter.com/JHaddix) , now the V4 is available check it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4JgIu1mceI) i never watched V4, so i can't tell you how it is, but the V3 is great.

* The Web Application Hacker's Handbook: Discovering and Exploiting Security Flaws (Yeah i now it's an old book, but it worth reading, it gives you a general idea and how things work in web pentest).
* Portswigger Web security academy (you don't have to complete at these material at the same time, mainly i use them as  a go to resources to learn knew thing and practice it at the same time).

[https://portswigger.net/web-security/all-materials](https://portswigger.net/web-security/all-materials) 

[https://portswigger.net/web-security/all-labs](https://portswigger.net/web-security/all-labs)

&#x200B;

* [OWASP WSTG](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/stable/)

I processed as follow : first i read the web application hacker's handbook, then i started practicing some labs from portswigger to get my self familiar with some vulnerabilities and their exploitation such as XSS, SQLi, OS Injection, CORS ...

(you can use [DVWA](http://www.dvwa.co.uk/) and [WebGoat](https://github.com/WebGoat/WebGoat) to practice many vulnerabilities exploitation, anyway the portswigger labs are great too). Some times you will need to create your own local lab.

Finally i used OWASP WSTG as full guide during my internship to test any possible vulnerability (use this after your preparation stage, when you are working on read target (legally of course, well or not, it's up to you, u never see me :) ).

# What i achieved in six months

At the end of my internship (six month), i reported 11 vulnerabilities including three account takeover by different means, XSS through unrestricted file upload, denial of service through unrestricted file upload combined with logic flaw ...

# Tools

Some useful tools which helped me :

* Burp suite community edition  (you can also use ZAP Proxy)
* Sqlmap
* nslookup, whatweb, nikto.
* Curl
* Ffuf & gobuster
* Scripting language (bash, python ...) : many times you will need to automate some tasks, example : generate the same token used by the application when reseting a password.
* Google !

You can use kali linux or one of other linux distributions (i can't tell you any thing about windows).

At the end there is no step by step guide (watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TofunAI6fU)) , you have to do it on your own, also it take time and effort, a lot of effort !, it's a good idea to following some of bug bounty hunter on twitter and read write-ups.  

**Remark** : i didn't talk about pentest types (Gray-box, Black-box ....) or also other pentest fields (Network pentest, mobile app pentest, wireless pentest). the object it to get you start, with time you will learn many more.

Good luck to you."

pentest,j7a3b3,Proof of ownership,n0p_sled,g83jzii,t3_j7a3b3,0,"A screenshot could be socially engineered by an attacker.

Ask the client to upload a txt file with a random filename to the root of their domain e.g. [https://www.clientdomain.com/bcinquewhfuh1n38uuyf8q1h32rfhc79qwfhex.txt](https://www.clientdomain.com/bcinquewhfuh1n38uuyf8q1h32rfhc79qwfhex.txt) with a name and contents you have both agreed on.

Once you've verified it's there, they can delete it. I honestly don't know about whether this would stand up in court, but if the client has a level of access that allows them to upload the file, then I doubt they'll need to use anything in your report maliciously in order to priv esc or exploit the site, as they can simply alter the code as they want.

Combine this with checking who owns the IP to be tested and WHOIS records.

I would also suggest getting a professional to look over your client contract, and make sure the client has signed it, with the scope clearly defined, and details who owns / has responsibility for what before scanning anything, as I suspect this will be the document that's contested if it ever goes to court. Although checking WHOIS and asking for the file upload should help prove that you took reasonable measures to confirm your client was who they said they were before proceeding.

Both of these have been used to fingerprint and track individuals. Especially if you have been identified with that device, you can be targeted as well. With enough sensors and other information like video footage, it can be used to make conclusions, like what things you like to buy, how fast you are moving, which can correlate height and weight. 

Another concept that was added is how that information can be recorded. Google knowing what access points you are near can pinpoint where you are, even with location services off. 

There was a post that talked about being able to make positive identification based on accelerometer data. Any data that is gather won't often be used for your benefit. It only takes one good algorithm to correlate more things based on movement. This is why people don't like Bluetooth beaconing often.

This was an effective method of getting around Non-Executable Stacks via returns into code bases that are already loaded into memory. A rather extensive category that is great to research is ret2libc style exploits. Jumping into the middle of functions or chaining together several read/write operations can yield enough cpu time and memory to enable an attackers shellcode to be executed or native executables to be leveraged.

Thank you,  can you please  make  an  example in C , a  barealy approssimated example  of  a  written shell code  which as you say ''set itself next to the next  function   which is going  to be executed in the  memory'' ? 

Because  I can't understand  this, I don't  want the  shell code, I am not trying to  skript  kidding neirher, I want  to understand the concept.

Let's  assume I have  an application  which  it accepts user' s  imputs, ok?  I want to write in them ''This instrunction I am writing in the imput box, has to be executed in the middle of the next to  this process'''

How  can I do it?

Since your budget is low, I would recommend to start with Burp Suite Pro. They have recently introduced a new built-in scanner which is good enough to find the easily exploitable items. 
In addition to this, I would strongly recommend to hire an experienced penetration tester who can thoroughly test your website and provide you with (not only) a report of findings, but also guide you on how these can be fixed from a technical perspective. They usually perform re-checks to make sure the findings are appropriately addressed. This should considerably narrow down the attack surface.

websecurity,ng216y,Suggestions for an effective and automated vulnerability web scanner tool for small-sized businesses and is user-friendly.,perezbox,gzbq6lq,t3_ng216y,0,"Something to think about is the time you are truly planning to spend identifying and remediating vulnerabilities. In my experience deploying tools for application security testing (which is what you're describing) is what you'd find in larger organizations, with teams designed to sift through the noise. For other organizations that lack the team, or technical knowledge, I tend to recommend using something like a Web Application Firewall (WAF). 

These firewalls do a lot of the heavy lifting for you. They have teams devoted to researching the latest vulnerabilities and patching them for you at the edge (most WAF solutions sit on a CDN's edge). 

So the question I think you should be asking yourself is  if you really want to get into the business of application security testing, or if you want to just get them  patched for you at the edge. 

Mind you, it's not to say that AST is not valuable and doesn't have it's benefits. I just haven't found a good use case for smaller organizations with limited knowledge and teams. 

Not sure what kind of CMS you're using, but I use WordPress on a lot of my online properties and use [NOC.org](https://NOC.org) for the CDN / WAF.

And your ISP is more ""permanent"": it's pretty easy to change to a different VPN company (you could do it every 3 months if you wished), but hard to change ISP (they tend to have semi-monopolies in geographic areas).

False.  There is no benefit to your Tor/onion traffic.  But there are significant benefits for your **non-Tor** traffic, and your system is doing that traffic at unpredictable times, even while you're using Tor Browser."

websecurity,kuqv4b,Tracking seeming related users/activity,ScottContini,gj2o4w0,t3_kuqv4b,0,"That's really rotten.

It sounds like you don't have authentication (unless bad users are not creating a new account every time), so I'll assume there is a good reason for that.

It's a tough problem, really.  A skilled person can hide their IP and geo-location with little effort, so tracking the person can be a difficult task.  If they are not skilled in hiding themselves, then you can do things like track IP, geolocation, user agent details, etc....  You could even do sneaky things like fingerprint the browser by considering things like which plugins they are using, but that might be viewed quite negatively.  You can also put cookies on their device that are unique to the user, so you can know which people are dropping out and prevent them from playing more reliable people.  Yes, that's easy to get around, but it all depends upon what they know and what efforts they put into trying to be avoided.

Hmmm, here's a thought.  Maybe you can put a digitally signed (for example, use HMAC) cookie on the person's device that tracks number of completed games.  Whenever they complete a game, you increment the value in the cookie by 1 and sign it.  Then, when somebody wants to play somebody else, you can match people with high counts of completed games, and avoid a high-count person competing with a low count person.  Of course you need to verify the signature every time.

JWTs are a convenient structure to use for this cookie.  But you will want to put something in there that prevents the cookie from being transferred to somebody else.  That could be a bit tricky given the lack of authentication, but there are heuristics you can come up with related to some of the fingerprinting tricks talked about above."
websecurity,kuqv4b,Tracking seeming related users/activity,GamersPlane,gj2s6vo,t1_gj2o4w0,1,"So I do have auth, but the bad actor/actors are creating new accounts each time with throwaway emails.

websecurity,kuqv4b,Tracking seeming related users/activity,ScottContini,gj2tskj,t1_gj2s6vo,2,"If you do have auth, that makes it a lot easier.  

Same idea as before -- track how many times a person has played, but this time you don't need cookies to do it.  Instead, store it in your internal database.  Then when you match people up, you either only let new people play other new people, or else you make it visible to players how reliable their opponent is (such as: ""Warning: this player is new"").

EDIT: I guess you have thought of something like this, and you really want to prevent a bad person from coming back.  But this can be very hard to do if bad person is clever.  I think the better approach is let people earn a reputation and make that reputation visible or else don't let people without a reputation play somebody with a good reputation."

websecurity,kjn8gq,Dealing with copying of persistent login cookies,IAmRocketMan,ggybf8m,t3_kjn8gq,0,"What you described is expected. Most sites are vulnerable to copying the session and pasting it on another browser so the goal is to protect session tokens by ensuring your code isn’t vulnerable to XSS or leaks session tokens in some other way.

But to answer your question:

You could fingerprint it by hashing the ip address and browser user agent, but it creates more issues than it’s worth. For example, what if user updates their browser to a new version or what if they switch from wifi to cellular and gets a new ip. 

So what do other sites do? Some of them set a time to live (ttl) so the session expires relatively quickly, for example every 2 hours. 

In the case the session gets stolen, it’s only valid for 2 hours.

As for persisting the session with a short TTL, the server can update the TTL on each request or a better approach is to store a refresh token on the client (like via localStorage) so when the session is about to expire, it uses the refresh token to generate a new session."
websecurity,kjn8gq,Dealing with copying of persistent login cookies,dr_reverend,ggye42n,t1_ggybf8m,1,"The user base for this is going to be quite limited and regulated.

I wouldn't fingerprint using IP as that would cause problems for my user base but I do expect them to use the same browser on any one computer. If they do switch browsers or something its not going to be often and logging in again isn't that big a deal.

> As for persisting the session with a short TTL

I'll have to look into using localStorage. I'm thinking I could have that refresh token created only at the time of the initial login and then just verified when using persistent cookie authentication.

Do I really think that my little web app is at risk of someone copying the authorization tokens? Not really no, but it was a potential, easy attack that I thought I should try to fix. 

At this point it seems that fingerprinting is the only option do deal with this. It’s not perfect for sure and the statistical chance for collisions is pretty high but with the small user base I think it would stop anyone at my level and I’m ok with that."
